    "text": "Activity-based models (ABMs) have been championed by researchers and many practitioners as being theoretically superior to the trip-based models historically used in transportation planning efforts since the 1950s.\nDespite the theoretical benefits, many agencies have delayed or declined to transition to an ABM citing additional data requirements, staff training, computational resources, and related concerns. There is also not a consensus that ABMs result in better infrastructure volume forecasts, the primary—or even sole—purpose of many regions’ travel demand analysis efforts.\nIn this research, we investigate the quality and characteristics of travel analyses enabled by an ABM. We do this by applying an array of infrastructure and behavior scenarios to both an ABM and a trip-based model representing the Wasatch Front (Salt Lake City) region of Utah, USA. The results will compare the implications of each model and help inform agencies that are considering adopting an ABM.\nThe document proceeds in a typical fashion: Chapter 2 provides a discussion of the differences between trip-based models and ABMs, alongside a discussion of previous studies examining the theoretical and analytical benefits of each framework. Chapter 3 first describes the model frameworks used in this research, namely the regional trip-based model and an activity-based model constructed to support research activities in the region; this section also describes three scenarios designed to test the usefulness and applicability of the different model frameworks. Chapters 4–6 describe the findings from each scenario, alongside a discussion of their limitations and implications. Chapter 7 provides a series of recommendations and opportunities for future research.",

    "text": "2.1 Overview of Model Types\nTrip-based models are often referred to as “four-step” models due to their four fundamental sub-models: trip generation, trip distribution, mode choice, and network assignment (National Academies 2012, 28). They can be more complicated than this, possibly including integration with a land use forecast, iteration between mode and destination choice, etc., but the “four steps” are the central component of any of these models (McNally 2007).\nIn a typical trip-based model, travel demand is predicted based on aggregate population data, often delineated by each transportation analysis zone (TAZ). Each sub-model relies on this aggregate data; for example, the modal split sub-model will often use average TAZ income as an input (National Academies 2012, 14). The aggregate data is also often “disaggregated” and segmented along variables such as household size and vehicle ownership. Regardless of the segmentation variables used in the first three model steps, the resulting trip matrices by mode and time of day are then assigned to a transportation network (there are various algorithms for doing so, see Ortúzar and Willumsen (2011)).\nActivity-based models differ significantly from this approach. Rather than using aggregate data, ABMs use data representing an actual or synthetic population, with individual person and household data (Vovsha, Bradley, and Bowman 2005). These models use an activity or tour scheduler to assign a daily activity pattern (DAP) of zero or more tours to each individual (n.b. a tour is a series of trips that begin and end at home). These DAPs are restricted temporally, spatially, and modally; i.e., each person has a logical and followable sequence of trips and activities (Bowman 1998). A “drive alone” trip from work to lunch, for example, cannot be made if transit was taken to work. ABMs output a list of tours and trips by person, time, location, and type, and these can then be assigned to a transportation network in a similar manner as in a trip-based model.",

    "section": "2.2 Comparison of Modeling Frameworks",
    "text": "2.2 Comparison of Modeling Frameworks\nIn discussing the differences between ABMs and trip-based models, there are really two comparisons that need to be made: how the population data is structured, and how travel is organized. Trip-based models generally use aggregate population data while ABMs use a synthetic population, and trip-based models organize travel into trips while ABMs organize travel into activities and tours. The following sections will explain these aspects of travel demand modeling and discuss the claimed advantages and disadvantages of each model type.\n\nPopulation Data\nThe aggregate population data used in trip-based models can vary in origin and level of detail, but the basic concept is the same: the study area is organized into generally small zones, and certain demographic and socioeconomic data is known or obtained for each zone (National Academies 2012, 14). This includes data such as number of households, average household income, population, number of workers, etc. Based on this information, the zone can be segmented along arbitrary variables. For example, since households with more workers and more vehicles tend to make more work trips, it is useful to estimate the distribution of households in each zone along these two variables. Then, average trip production rates are determined for each household category (e.g. for households with each number of workers by vehicles), and the total number of trips produced in a zone is calculated based on these rates (National Academies 2012, 37).\nThis approach is relatively straightforward: the required input data is usually easy to obtain, the trip generation models are often simple, and it is computationally inexpensive (National Academies 2012). However, the types of analyses possible are limited by the initial segmentation of the aggregate population data. An analysis based on parents’/adults’ highest received education, for example, would require determining the number of households in each TAZ with each possible combination of education level. This can theoretically be done, but more detailed and varied analyses would require more levels of segmentation, greatly increasing the number of classifications needed. Aggregation at any point precludes that segmentation from use in subsequent model steps as well as in any post-hoc analysis. Since these segmentations need to be carried through each model step, trip rates, mode choice equations, etc. need to be estimated for every classification, and while relevant real-world data may exist, sample sizes approach zero very quickly, and so the estimates have little statistical value (Moeckel et al. 2020; National Academies 2012).\nThis becomes a particular issue in equity analysis because it is perhaps impossible to determine equitable distribution of “winners” and “losers” of a potential policy without using demographic variables in the trip generation and destination and mode choice steps (Bills and Walker 2017). Though many studies have shown that trip production and mode choice behavior differ by ethnic group even after controlling for income (cite?), including such variables in trip-based models is problematic. Does coding such a variable in a mode choice model represent discrimination? Or does doing so assert that present differences resulting from unequal opportunity will persist into the future planning years? Regardless the reasons for their exclusion, these variables consequently cannot be used in a post-hoc analysis of a transportation policy because the trip matrices do not contain the adequate segmentation.\nAn alternative approach to population data is to use a full synthetic population. A synthetic population takes demographic and socioeconomic data at various levels of detail to create a “population” with generally the same distribution as the study area (National Academies 2012, 93). The goal is to have a population that is functionally similar to the actual population, but without the privacy concerns of using real individual household data. Castiglione et al. (2006) argue that the major advantage with this approach is that the demographic and socioeconomic data is known at the person and household level, rather than the zone level, and this data remains available throughout the modeling process. This allows, for example, an equity analysis to determine the “winners” and “losers” of a proposed development without needing to encode demographic variables into each step of the model.\nBills and Walker (2017) used the 2000 Bay Area Travel Survey to create a synthetic population and compare the effects that certain scenarios had on high income and low income populations. With a 20% reduction in travel cost, they found that high income workers benefited more than low income workers. They did similar comparisons for scenarios involving reduced travel times for different mode choices and saw the effects each scenario had on the high and low income workers. These types of analysis, which are not possible with aggregate population data (this is actually possible; a lot of trip-based models segment high/low income), can be very valuable in transportation planning and policy making.\nIt is important to note that while many connect them only with ABMs, synthetic populations can be used in running trip-based models as well. Trip-based models using a synthetic population—often called trip-based microsimulation models—do exist (see Walker (2005) and Moeckel et al. (2020)), but these are relatively rare.\nFigure 2.1 gives a visualization of an example “information pipeline” for a trip-based model using aggregate data and an ABM using a synthetic population. In the aggregate data model, it is impossible to know which trips are made by e.g. 2-worker, 1-vehicle, low-income households; it only describes which trips are made by households with fewer vehicles than workers. With a synthetic population, however, individuals are being modeled, and so each trip can be traced to a specific person. All information is known at each point in the model regardless of which data is used in previous steps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Trip-based\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Activity-based\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Example “information pipeline” for a trip-based model and an ABM.\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel Behavior\nThe other primary difference between trip-based models and ABMs—and the main difference from trip-based microsimulation models—is that ABMs organize travel into “tours”, a sequence of trips that begin and end at the home, rather than just trips. It should be noted that Miller (2023) argues that many current “activity-based” models ought to be labeled “tour-based” due to this focus on building tours. This is contrasted with “activity scheduling” models, in which activity participation is modeled explicitly and trips emerge as the means to get from one activity to the next. However, in practice there are few true “activity scheduling” models, and the term “activity-based” is used to refer to both activity scheduling and tour-based models.\nIn a typical trip-based model, trips are forecasted based on empirical trip rates, usually by trip purpose and by household type (for example, low-income, 1-vehicle households make a certain number of “home-based work” trips) (McNally 2007). These trips are then assigned an origin and destination, mode, and often a time of day (peak/off-peak, etc.), resulting in a list of trips between each zone by mode and purpose. A trip-based microsimulation model may use regression models rather than aggregate data for some of the model steps (Moeckel et al. 2020), but the end result is similar: a list of trips by person, noting mode and purpose. However, this trip list may be inconsistent, and the forecasted trips may not be physically possible to complete in any sequence, as there is no sense of “trip-chaining”. The hope, though, is that over an area the inconsistencies would cancel out, leaving an overall accurate forecast.\nABMs, on the other hand, model tours rather than trips. This attempts to create consistency in trip origins/destinations, mode choice, and time of day: since each trip is a part of a “chain” (tour), the trips within a tour are dependent on each other (Rasouli and Timmermans 2014). The open-source ABM ActivitySim (Association of Metropolitan Planning Organizations 2023), for example, has a tour-scheduling model that determines the number of “mandatory” (work, school, etc.) and “discretionary” tours each individual will make, and performs tour-level mode and destination choice for each tour. After the tour-level decisions are made, trip-level mode/destination choice is done for each trip in the tour, including the possible addition of subtours (see Vovsha, Bradley, and Bowman (2005), fig. 18.1).\nFigures ?fig-network-aggregate and ?fig-network-synth show an example of the trips assigned to a network in the various model forms. ?fig-network-aggregate depicts network assignment in a typical trip-based model where the total number of trips between each zone is given. With these results, the mode and purpose of each trip is known, but, with aggregate data, there is no way of telling who made which trips other than the segmentation in the previous steps (see Figure 2.1 (a)). It is also not possible to construct a coherent daily list of trips for individuals.\n?fig-network-synth, on the other hand, depicts visual representations of an individual’s travel made possible by the use of a synthetic population. ?fig-network-synth-1 depicts the trip list that could be given for an individual in a trip-based microsimulation model. Though each individual’s trips are known, there is no guarantee of consistency between trips. For example, it could predict that the individual takes transit to work but then drives home or that the individual makes two recreational trips without ever making a return trip. The activity-based approach, depicted in ?fig-network-synth-2, attempts to add this consistency by modeling tours, and only generating trips consistent with each tour.\nIn addition to intra-person dependencies, Rasouli and Timmermans (2014) note that ABMs can model dependencies between members of a household as well. A vehicle can’t be used by multiple people in the same household at the same time to travel to different destinations. Because the people within the household will have travel patterns that depend on the patterns of others in the household, a policy affecting one person in the household can affect everyone in the household no matter how directly the policy connects to them (Vovsha, Bradley, and Bowman 2005). These effects aren’t possible to forecast in a trip-based model.\nAnother advantage of organizing travel into tours comes regarding accessibility analyses. Dong et al. (2006) note that when trip-based models are used to analyze accessibility, each zone must be analyzed independently of travel behavior. This approach only analyzes zones’ proximity to each other and does not take into account individual travel patterns. They argue that this is a limited view of accessibility, and discuss the “activity-based accessibility measure” (ABA), which is evaluated based on all trips in a day rather than particular trips. As an example, if an individual doesn’t live within a 20-minute drive of a grocery store, traditional measures might rate this as poor accessibility. However, if they travel to a park with a nearby grocery store as part of their DAP, then in reality the accessibility should be rated much higher. This proximity may even influence which park is chosen. Overall, they found that the ABA predicts more reasonable accessibility outcomes compared to traditional measures.",

    "section": "2.3 Lack of ABM Adoption",
    "text": "2.3 Lack of ABM Adoption\nThough ABMs have many clear advantages over trip-based models, adoption among agencies has been relatively slow. Many ABMs are implemented in proprietary software, which creates difficulty in maintaining and iterating on the model, Miller (2023) argues. Even in an open-source model like ActivitySim (Association of Metropolitan Planning Organizations 2023), Miller notes several disadvantages of ABMs:\n\nComputational inefficiency and complicated program design: ABMs take more time, more computing power, and more money to run. This is because the synthetic population needed to run an ABM uses much more data. In areas with thousands of TAZs and millions of people, a super computer is needed, and it will cost much more than what is spent to run trip-based models. If a city can see similar results using a trip-based model, they may decide not to invest in an ABM.\nAbsence of a standard model system: The modeling systems are often designed with different approaches and for specific areas making it hard to transfer from one urban area to another. This also makes it difficult for agencies to determine which approach is the best and decide which to implement. In relation to this, Miller also states that the pressures of publishing unique and ground-breaking research in academia can deter researchers from converging towards best theories and methods.\nLack of resources: Most of these models were developed in academic settings which often lack resources, and possibly desire, to put them into practice. This leaves it up to governments and consultants to put the models into practice, but they can be hesitant to promote software development and to invest in new systems.\n\nFor these reasons, as well as the inertia of current practices, the majority of agencies and organizations in the US remain using trip-based models for demand forecasting and policy analysis.",

    "section": "2.4 Research Gap",
    "text": "2.4 Research Gap\nAlthough there has been much research on ABMs and their theoretical advantages, practical comparisons of the model frameworks have been limited. It is often taken as given that ABMs are unilaterally superior to traditional trip-based models due to their better theoretical foundation, but it is not clear if that better foundation always yields better results in terms of analytical flexibility or policy outcomes. Ferdous et al. (2012) compared the trip- and activity-based model frameworks of the Mid-Ohio Regional Planning Commission and found that the ABM performed slightly better at the region level, but about the same at the project level. This is not an overwhelming victory for ABMs, and so based on this an agency may reasonably decide that the increase in data, computational, training, and potentially financial requirements outweigh the potential gains of switching to an ABM.\nFerdous et al. (2012), however, mainly compared the accuracy of the two frameworks, but did not address the methodological differences between them. What types of data collection/synthesis are needed for each model type? Are there analyses that can only be done through (or that are made easier by) one of the model types? What would an agency need in order to transition from a trip-based model to an ABM? Are certain types of scenarios suited to one model type? Though some of these questions have been discussed (see e.g. Lemp, McWethy, and Kockelman 2007), a holistic methodological comparison is lacking. Additionally, the answers in the current literature are mainly theoretical, with little use to an agency considering the transition.\nThis research aims to answer these questions by providing a side-by-side comparison of a potential trip-based and activity-based modeling methodology. Several “proposed development” scenarios are run in each model, and the strengths and weaknesses of each approach are compared. It is important to note that this paper is not focused on model accuracy, as in any model type this can be adjusted dramatically through calibration efforts. Rather, the focus is on the methodological differences between the approaches, and the types of analyses that can be done with each model type.\n\n\n\n\nAssociation of Metropolitan Planning Organizations. 2023. “ActivitySim.” ActivitySim. https://activitysim.github.io/.\n\n\nBills, Tierra S., and Joan L.

WFRC provided the model directly, including land use forecasts and the current long-range transportation plan. The model is taken essentially as-is, with no changes other than those noted in Chapters 4–6.\nThe WFRC model, like many trip-based models, requires the following inputs:\nLike many trip-based models, the WFRC model follows the “four-step” approach and has main steps of trip generation, trip distribution, mode choice, and network assignment. The model also includes a disaggregation step at the beginning where the TAZ-level data is used via lookup tables to estimate the number of households by size, income group, number of workers, and auto ownership. The trip generation step uses lookup tables for each household type to determine the number of trips produced by purpose. Trip attractions are determined based on the number of jobs in each TAZ, with differing coefficients by job type. Trip distribution uses a gravity model of the form\n\\[\nT_{ij} = P_i \\times \\frac{A_j  F_{ij}}{\\displaystyle \\sum_J A_j  F_{ij}},\n\\]\nwhere \\(T_{ij}\\) is the number of trips from zone \\(i\\) to \\(j\\), \\(P_i\\) is the productions at \\(i\\), \\(A_j\\) is the attractions at \\(j\\), \\(F_{ij}\\) is the cost term/function from \\(i\\) to \\(j\\), and \\(J\\) is the set of all zones trips from \\(i\\) can be attracted to. Mode choice uses a choice model to assign a percentage of trips of each purpose to each mode.

    "text": "3.2 ActivitySim\nActivitySim is an open-source ABM led by a consortium of transportation planning agencies. ActivitySim is highly configurable, and many agencies have their own bespoke implementation. This paper uses an ActivitySim implementation based on (macfarlane2021?), which is in turn based on the prototype configuration for the Metropolitan Transportation Commission serving the San Francisco area (cite?).\nActivitySim requires similar inputs to the WFRC model, though it does not assign traffic and so does not require any transportation networks. Additionally, ActivitySim requires population data at an individual level, including information such as age, household income, and home location. Due to privacy concerns, real data is rarely used for this purpose, and a synthetic population representative of the study area is used instead. Section 3.2.1 discusses the population used in more detail.\nActivitySim, like all ABMs, simulates transportation decisions on an individual level. ActivitySim has a hierarchical decision tree, where long-term decisions (such as auto ownership and telecommute frequency) are made first, followed by daily and tour- and trip-level decisions such as scheduling and mode choice (see Figure 3.1). Each of these steps determines information that will be used in subsequent steps, and many steps can be turned on or off depending on what is needed for the model implementation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: ActivitySim sub-model flowchart. Long-term decisions are made first, followed by more granular ones.\n\n\n\nThe steps can broadly be categorized into five groups, as shown in Figure 3.1: aggregate, household/personal, daily, tour-level, and trip-level steps. The aggregate steps mainly involve determining impedance measures between each pair of zones (travel time, distance, cost, etc.). In this case, these impedances are supplied directly as network skims, output from the WFRC model.\nThe household/personal steps relate to long-term decisions that are unlikely to change quickly based on daily transportation conditions. These steps include determining remote work status, work/school location, auto ownership, transit pass ownership, and free parking availability at work. Much of this information can be supplied directly or explicitly modeled. This ActivitySim implementation does not supply any of this information directly, and explicitly models remote work status, work/school location, auto ownership, and free parking availability. Transit pass ownership is not modeled.\nThe daily decisions primarily concern an individual’s DAP. ActivitySim contains a step to assign mandatory, non-mandatory, and joint tours based on personal and household information (joint tours combine both mandatory and non-mandatory activities). For example, full-time workers are more likely to make a mandatory tour than part-time workers, all else being equal.\nOnce a DAP is chosen, ActivitySim creates tours for each major activity in the day. Additionally, ActivitySim determines if an individual makes an “at-work” tour (e.g. leaving for lunch and returning to the workplace). Each tour is scheduled and assigned a primary mode, as well as a primary destination for non-mandatory and joint tours. The tours are then populated with trips, and ActivitySim assigns each trip a purpose, destination, time of day, and mode compatible with the tour-level assignment.\nThe final steps of ActivitySim are writing output trip matrices and other tables, including information on land use, persons, households, tours, and trips. \n\nPopulationSim\nThis paper uses PopulationSim (cite?) to create a synthetic population for ActivitySim. The synthetic population aims to be representative of the study area while maintaining privacy. PopulationSim takes as input a “seed” of individuals and households, and populates the area with copies of these to match given control totals.\nThe seed sample comes from the 2019 American Community Survey Public Use Microdata Sample (pums?), which contains a sample of actual (anonymized) individuals and households at the Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA) geography (PUMAs partition the United States into areas of around 100,000 people each (puma?)). The control totals come from two different sources: the U.S. Census and the WFRC model. Table 3.1 shows these controls as well as their geographic level and source. PopulationSim also allows setting different weights to each control, and Table 3.1 gives this information as well.\n\n\n\n\nTable 3.1: PopulationSim Control Totals by Geography and Source\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nControl\nGeography\nSource\nWeight\n\n\n\n\nPopulation\nEntire Region\nCensus\n5,000\n\n\nNumber of Households\nTAZ\nWFRC Model\n1,000,000,000\n\n\nHousehold Size\nCensus Tract\nCensus\n10,000\n\n\nPersons by Age Group\nCensus Tract\nCensus\n10,000\n\n\nHouseholds by Income Group\nCensus Tract\nCensus\n500\n\n\nWorkers per Household\nCensus Tract\nCensus\n1,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost of these controls come from Census data, with only the number of households per TAZ coming from the WFRC model data. Note also that there are many personal and household variables that are not accounted for in these controls, such as sex, vehicle ownership, internet access, etc. These variables are not controlled for and are dependent on which seed persons or households are copied in controlling for the other variables. However, this process is assumed to still give a representative enough estimate for the uncontrolled variables without needing to model them explicitly.\nThe outputs of PopulationSim include a persons and households table comprising the synthetic population, as well as summary tables.",

    "text": "3.3 Initial Model Comparison/Calibration\nWhile this research does not directly compare the outputs of ActivitySim to those of the WFRC model, it is important to ensure similar performance between the two models for meaningful analyses. As such, a baseline scenario in both models is used in order to calibrate the ActivitySim implementation to the WFRC model. This baseline scenario uses the 2019 WFRC model as-is. For ActivitySim, the baseline scenario uses 2019 Census and WFRC data to create the synthetic population, and the choice models use land use data and network skims from the baseline WFRC scenario.\n\nVerification of the Synthetic Population\nThe controls for PopulationSim mostly come from the Census, as can be seen in Table 3.1. However, the WFRC model contains TAZ-level data including population and median income. The WFRC model also has a disaggregation step that estimates the number of households by size and income group. \nThis section compares the output of PopulationSim to the WFRC model on each of these variables at the TAZ level.\nFigure 3.2 shows the difference in TAZ population between PopulationSim and the WFRC data. It is worth noting that since the number of households was controlled at the TAZ level from the WFRC data with an extremely high weight, the number of households per TAZ in the synthetic population match exactly to the WFRC data. The average household size will therefore follow a similar error distribution to the one shown in Figure 3.2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: population comparison\n\n\n\n\n\nThe population per TAZ is similar to the WFRC data in most places, though there are some discrepancies especially near Herriman and Lehi. Since total population is a region-level control, but number of households is a TAZ-level control, this shows PopulationSim is predicting a smaller average household size in Herriman and Lehi than the WFRC data suggests. \nIncome is also an important factor in travel behavior (cite?), and Figure 3.3 shows a TAZ-level comparison of median income between the synthetic population and the WFRC data. The synthetic population does have a lower median income than the WFRC data in many TAZs, but the error is in most cases fairly small, especially in more populated areas. However, both the WFRC model and ActivitySim use household income groups rather than individual household income to inform travel decisions. These groups are taken from the WFRC model (see Table 3.2), and the groups in PopulationSim and ActivitySim were adjusted to match. Figure 3.4 shows the difference in number of households by income group, and this figure shows a similar trend of PopulationSim over-predicting low-income households.\n\n\n\n\nTable 3.2: income groups\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome Group\nIncome Range\n\n\n\n\n1\n≤ $45,000\n\n\n2\n$45,000–$75,000\n\n\n3\n$75,000–$125,000\n\n\n4\n≥ $125,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: med inc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4: inc groups\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome was not weighted very heavily as a control in PopulationSim (see Table 3.1), and this is in part why there are discrepancies between the models. However, the overall distribution of income is similar between the models, as Figure 3.5 shows. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.5: inc density\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVerification and Calibration of ActivitySim\nThis section compares the outputs of both models to verify that trip patterns roughly agree between them. There are three comparisons of interest between the outputs of the two models: mode split, trip length frequency distribution, and remote work.\nThe initial baseline ActivitySim scenario predicted a mode split significantly different to that from the WFRC model, and so calibration efforts were needed. We adjusted the alternative-specific constants in ActivitySim’s mode choice model to better match the mode split in the WFRC model. Table 3.3 compares the mode split of both models after several iterations of this calibration. Overall, the calibration resulted in a reasonably similar mode split between the two models, though there are still discrepancies (e.g. ActivitySim is predicting about twice as many transit trips as the WFRC model). However, further adjustment of the constants would cause their values to become unreasonably large, as ActivitySim’s mode split begins converging at this point regardless of the calibration constant values (see Figure 3.6). This is likely due to the mode choice coefficients being unrepresentative of the study area. This ActivitySim configuration is ultimately based on the San Francisco area, and so coefficients on variables such as travel time and income are calibrated for that area (hence in part why there are so many more transit trips).\n\n\n\n\nTable 3.3: mode split\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPurpose\nMode\nActivitySim predicted trips\nWFRC predicted trips\n% Error\n% Error (scaled to WFRC predicted trips)\n\n\n\n\nAuto\nHome-based Other\n3042754\n4096688\n-1053934\n-25.7%\n\n\nNon-motorized\nHome-based Other\n591164\n510143\n81021\n15.9%\n\n\nTransit\nHome-based Other\n218438\n37346\n181092\n484.9%\n\n\nAuto\nHome-based Work\n1288620\n1586414\n-297794\n-18.8%\n\n\nNon-motorized\nHome-based Work\n191880\n76506\n115374\n150.8%\n\n\nTransit\nHome-based Work\n189610\n48752\n140858\n288.9%\n\n\nAuto\nNon–home-based\n1645356\n2224878\n-579522\n-26.0%\n\n\nNon-motorized\nNon–home-based\n224248\n146404\n77844\n53.2%\n\n\nTransit\nNon–home-based\n103398\n13453\n89945\n668.6%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.6: calibration plot\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.7 compares the trip length frequency distribution of the two models by mode and purpose. Both ActivitySim and the WFRC model contain destination choice models which can be adjusted to affect the distribution of trip length. However, as the figure shows, the two models have similar TLFDs, so no adjustment was necessary. The most significant discrepancies are with transit trips, again likely due to this configuration of ActivitySim being calibrated to San Francisco, making transit more attractive. Note that though these distributions match well enough for the purposes of this research, further calibration would be required to create a production-ready ActivitySim implementation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.7: tlfd comparison\n\n\n\n\n\nThe WFRC model has basic support for predicting telecommuting and work-from-home trips. This includes a lookup table of telecommute percentages based on job type and year. ActivitySim also has this functionality, and can additionally use individual- and household-level variables in its predictions. It is worth noting that both the WFRC model and ActivitySim make a distinction between “telecommuting”, where an individual commutes to work some days and does not others, and “work-from-home” (or “home-based jobs” in the WFRC model), where an individual’s workplace is always at their home.\nBoth models treat “work-from-home”/“home-based jobs” similarly. The WFRC model’s land use data contains employment by type in each TAZ, and it considers a “home-based job” as a separate job type, so these are not counted toward employment totals in trip generation and subsequent steps. ?fig-wfrc-wfh shows the distribution of home-based job percentage by TAZ in the WFRC land use data. ActivitySim has a “work from home” submodel which assigns workers work-from-home status based on personal variables such as income, sex, and education (coefficients on these variables were left unchanged from the existing configuration). There is also a “target work-from-home percent” value that adjusts the model to reach the specified work-from-home proportion of all workers. Individuals with work-from-home status are then prohibited from making a mandatory tour. There are no other adjustments to the ActivitySim work-from-home submodel.\nThe two models differ in their approach to telecommuting, however. The WFRC model has a lookup table of telecommuting shares based on job type (see Table 3.4), including predictions for future years. ActivitySim has a “telecommute frequency” submodel which assigns workers a telecommute status indicating the number of days they work remotely per week. Based on this status, ActivitySim adjusts the likelihood of making a mandatory tour. Telecommute status depends on personal variables similar to those in the work-from-home submodel by default. In order to calibrate to the WFRC data, however, we added additional job type variables to ActivitySim to match those given in Table 3.4. Because these are choice coefficients rather than target percentages, the values needed to be calibrated to match the WFRC targets. The calibration allowed ActivitySim to match these targets exactly, and the coefficients are given in Table 3.4.\n\n\n\nTable 3.4: wfrc telecommute data\n\n\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 6\n   name            wfrc_2019 wfrc_2050 `1 day` `2–3 days` `4 days`\n   &lt;chr&gt;               &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Retail             0.027          0   0.312      0.125    0.078\n 2 Food               0.0187        NA  -0.368     -0.148   -0.092\n 3 Manufacturing      0.0202        NA   0.038      0.015    0.01 \n 4 Office             0.0666        NA   1.78       0.712    0.445\n 5 Gov't/Education    0.0167        NA  -0.56      -0.224   -0.14 \n 6 Health             0.0286        NA   0.158      0.063    0.039\n 7 Agriculture        0.0693        NA   2.26       0.904    0.566\n 8 Mining             0.0053        NA  -2.03      -0.81    -0.511\n 9 Construction       0.0328        NA   0.816      0.326    0.204\n10 Other              0.0537        NA   1.54       0.614    0.384",

    "text": "3.4 Example Scenarios\nThere are three proposed scenarios to implement and run in each model for comparison. \nThis is not a comprehensive list covering all potential scenario possibilities, but is taken to represent many of the types of scenarios an agency would analyze.\nThe first scenario involves a change in land use near the former state prison site in Draper, Utah. Current plans for this site involve new development known as “The Point”, which will add high-density housing and commercial development to the area. \nThis research scenario will be based on this development, but will include only the land use changes. The actual development plans also include expansion of transit, but this will not be a part of this scenario.\nThe second scenario centers around an augmentation of transit service along the Wasatch Front. The FrontRunner, a CRT line connecting Provo to Ogden, is slated for expansion. The expansion includes additional stations and increased travel speeds due to vehicle electrification. This scenario models these changes in accordance with the planned expansion of the service. \nThe third scenario addresses the growing trend of remote work. Given technological advancements and the notable surge in remote work during the COVID-19 pandemic, this scenario models a substantial increase in remote work based on projections from WFRC. \nEach of these scenarios is based on the baseline 2019 scenario in the respective model, and ignores any additional expected growth or development beyond the specific changes of each scenario. For example, the increased WFH scenario uses WFH projections from 2050, but land use and socioeconomic data from 2019. These scenarios are therefore not realistic, but they serve as illustrative examples of the types of planning and development scenarios agencies may wish to analyze.\nAll three of these scenarios are coded in both the WFRC model and ActivitySim. The results (Chapters 4–6) describe the process of coding each scenario and analyzing them, as well as the analyses themselves.\n\n\n\n\nBentley Systems. n.d. “CUBE Modeling Software.” Accessed October 3, 2023. https://www.bentley.com/software/cube/.",
