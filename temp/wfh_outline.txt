# WFH

Third scenario models WFH.

Uses WFRC projections from 2050.

Show plot of some kind showing increase from 2019 to 2050.

## Create scenario

WFRC needs only to move 2050 data to 2019 for TC% and HBJ (in SE file ***ask Kamryn if we did this part***).

Asim is the same as calibration for the baseline scenario, but with different target %s. List these. (table of %s and coefficients for 2019/2050 side-by-side?)
