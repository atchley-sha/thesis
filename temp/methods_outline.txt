# Methods

We are comparing TBMs to ABMs.

We will forecast several specific scenarios and get an idea of computing resources.

## Scenarios

The first scenario is change in land use.

The second scenario is increased transit service.

The third scenario is increased WFH.

All three of these scenarios will be coded in both a representative TBM and ABM.

## WFRC Model

What it is, where it's from.

Inputs required.

How the model works; enumerate and describe each step.
Probably multiple paragraphs.

Model outputs.

## ASIM

What it is (based on Day et al, in turn based on MTC).

How it works (overview/flowchart).

Describe steps.
Definitely multiple paragraphs.

### Popsim

What it is.

List inputs (wfrc/census).

(Why not only WFRC?).

Table describing controls.

Outputs?

## Initial model comparison/calibration

We want to calibrate.

Describe baseline scenario for calibration.

### Synth Pop

We compared key attributes (taz population, income, etc).
Number of HH is identical.

Comparison of population totals.

Comparison of median income.

Comparison of income groups.

### Outputs/Trips

We compared mode split, tlfd, and wfh.

Mode split comparison/calibration.

TLFD comparison.

WFH comparison/calibration.
