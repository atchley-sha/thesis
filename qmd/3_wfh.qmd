# WFH {#sec-wfh}

{{< include _setup.qmd >}}

Third scenario models WFH.

Uses WFRC projections from 2050.

Show plot of some kind showing increase from 2019 to 2050.

## Create scenario

WFRC needs only to move 2050 data to 2019 for TC% and HBJ (in SE file ***ask Kamryn if we did this part***).

```{r}
#| label: tbl-wfrc-telecommute-years
#| tbl-cap: wfrc telecommute data

targets::tar_read(cube_telecommute_percentages_2)
```

Asim is the same as calibration for the baseline scenario, but with different target %s.
List these.
(table of %s and coefficients for 2019/2050 side-by-side?)

## Analyses

```{r}
targets::tar_read(combined_wfh_mode_split_diff)
```

```{r}
#| fig-cap: asim

targets::tar_read(cube_wfh_trip_pmt_diff)
```

```{r}
#| fig-cap: wfrc

targets::tar_read(asim_wfh_trip_pmt_diff)
```

```{r}
tar_read(combined_wfh_tlfd_diff_plot)
```
