# Scenario 3: Increase in Remote Work {#sec-wfh}

{{< include _setup.qmd >}}

A major question facing transportation planners since the COVID-19 regards the popularity of home-based work arrangements, whether involving full-time working from home or regular telecommuting [@ozimekFutureRemoteWork2020].
In this scenario, we consider the impact that an increase in remote work has on demand for travel in both the WFRC/MAG model and in ActivitySim.

## Scenario Creation

The WFRC/MAG model has basic support for predicting remote work.
In the work from home model, a certain number of workers are designated working at home based on zonal income and excluded from further model steps.
For telecommuting, the model uses a table of current and forecast telecommuting shares based on job type.
These trips are then also removed from the home-based work trip productions outputs.
To model the effect of an increase in working from home and telecommuting, we simply used the 2050 projected values in the 2019 base year calibration scenario.

The ActivitySim implementation based on San Francisco and discussed in @macfarlaneEstimationSimulationDaily2021 did not include remote work models.
However, a separate ActivitySim example implementation, developed for the Detroit (SEMCOG) metropolitan planning organization, *does* include these submodels.
The "work from home" submodel assign workers to work from home based on personal variables such as income, gender, and education with a "target work-from-home percent"; this was set to match the WFRC/MAG share of workers at home in the 2019 and 2050 scenarios.
Individuals with work-from-home status are then prohibited from making a mandatory tour, but would then have higher probability of making non-mandatory tours, reflecting a rebound effect [@moreno_microscopic_2017].
The "telecommute frequency" submodel then assigns workers probability they will telecommute on a given day.
Based on this status, ActivitySim adjusts the likelihood of selecting a mandatory activity pattern on the simulated travel day.
Telecommute status depends on personal variables, but also includes the individual's distance to work.
We added a job type variable --- based on the ACS PUMS industry classification available in the synthetic population --- to calibrate ActivitySim model to the WFRC/MAG telecommute share.

## Scenario Analysis

Both models decrease the number of work trips made as remote work rates increase.
However, the WFRC model does not account for a potential rebound effect.
This is seen in @tbl-wfh-trip-pmt-diff, where the WFRC model shows a decrease in home-based work and non--home-based trips, but virtually no change in home-based other trips.
ActivitySim on the other hand does account for the rebound, in that individuals working remotely on any given day may be more likely to make discretionary tours.

The WFRC model also does not consider trip length when adjusting trip rates due to remote work.
There is perhaps an implicit consideration in that remote work rates differ by job type and some job types are concentrated in certain areas.
@tbl-wfh-trip-pmt-diff illustrates this, where, for example, Home-based Work drive alone trips decreased by 6.3% relative to the baseline scenario, but person-miles traveled decreased only by 5.3%.
This shows that in fact the *shorter* work trips are being made less frequently with increased remote work rates in the WFRC model ActivitySim by contrast predicts a greater decrease in person-miles than in number of trips for home-based work trips, as seen in @tbl-wfh-trip-pmt-diff.
Additionally, for home-based other trips, ActivitySim predicts a greater increase in the number of trips than in person-miles, which shows that ActivitySim is at least implicitly modeling behavioral research findings [@moreno_microscopic_2017; @moeckel_working_2017].
