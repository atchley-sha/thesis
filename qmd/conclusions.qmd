In summary, this book has no content whatsoever.

## Computational resources

This research also includes an analysis of the computational resources required to run each model.

The WFRC model....

ActivitySim....

## Conclusions and Recommendations

ABM takes more computing power to run.
(maybe talk about that here) - "This" type of computing power would be ideal for a planning agency with an ABM

Each model works differently.
- There will be a learning curve when changing from TBM to ABM - Planning agencies should take this into account when switching

ABM is more malleable.
It was easy to throw on the WFH model without having to completely change the rest of the model, and it seemed more realistic than the TBM.
- For planning agencies wanting a model that more easily adapts to unforeseen travel behavior change, an ABM would be preferable

More analyses can be done with ABMs - We were able to replicate each TBM analysis with the ABM and more - We could make more demographic-type analyses with ABM - We were able to compare changes in individual behavior with ABM - Simpler to go about the analysis when thinking on the individual level

ActivitySim doesn't have the built in analysis tools like CUBE does (I think this is true, but not sure) - We had to use different programs to analyze ActivitySime output (like R)
