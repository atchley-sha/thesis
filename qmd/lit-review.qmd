# Literature Review {#sec-literature}

Travel demand modeling in the modern sense has its origins in the 1950's, with the Chicago Area Transportation Study [@chicago_area_transportation_study_final_1959] being one of the first urban planning studies to use the now-ubiquitous "four-step" modeling framework: trip generation, trip distribution, mode choice, and network assignment [@national_academies_travel_2012, p. 28].
In this framework, the fundamental unit of analysis is a trip from an origin to a destination, and such models are now the primary tool used in forecasting travel demand across the United States [@park_intrazonal_2020].

Rasouli and Timmermans @rasouli_activity-based_2014 give several shortcomings of trip-based models.
First, they use several sub-models that are (implicitly or explicitly) assumed independent, and this can result in a lack of consistency or integrity between sub-models.
For example, the assumed value of time in the mode choice model might be different than the assumed value of time in the tolling assignment model.
Second, these models are strongly aggregate in nature, which can cause significant aggregation bias with high and low values excluded.
Finally, they lack "behavioral realism"---that is, they do not have a concept of individuals making decisions, which is what travel behavior actually is.

Jones @jones_new_1979 proposed an alternative paradigm, namely an "activity-based" framework that models travel behavior at an individual rather than aggregate level.
An activity-based model places the focus on "activities" rather than "trips" as the basic unit of analysis, and predicts a sequence of activities for each individual and household, with information such as activity location, start time, and duration, using a high level of temporal and spatial granularity.
(It is noted that the models that have been operationalized in practice [e.g. @vovsha_activity-based_2005; @davidson2007a] are more appropriately referred to as "tour-based" models, as they predict a series of coherent tours rather than explicitly modeling the need for and participation in activities as envisioned by Jones @jones_new_1979; in this paper we use the term "activity-based models" in the way most commonly used in practical discourse.) "Trips" are then journeys from one activity to the next [@pinjari_activity-based_2011].
By adopting this activity-centric framework, activity-based models attempt to provide a more consistent and comprehensive representation of travel behavior.

Although activity-based models may be superior in certain theoretical aspects, they may also have practical disadvantages.
Miller @miller_current_2023 identifies three:

-   Computational inefficiency and complicated program design: operational activity-based models take more time, more computing power, and more money to run.
    This is because the synthetic population needed to run an activity-based model uses much more data, and because basic scalar matrix multiplication is swapped for complex logit-based choice models.
    If a region cannot run its analyses in a timely manner, they will not adopt an activity-based model.

-   Absence of a standard model system: The modeling systems are often designed with different approaches and for specific areas making it hard to transfer from one urban area to another.
    Further, the pressures of publishing unique and ground-breaking research in academia can deter researchers from converging towards best theories and methods.

-   Lack of resources: Most activity-based models are developed in academic settings which often lack resources, and possibly desire, to put them into practice.
    This leaves it up to governments and consultants to put the models into practice, but they can be hesitant to promote software development and to invest in new systems.

Practical comparisons of the model frameworks have been limited, however.
Castiglione et al. @castiglione_application_2006 argue that the major advantage with an activity-based approach is that the demographic and socioeconomic data is known at the person and household level, rather than aggregated at the zone level.
Decisions in each model step are tied to a specific individual, and so the individual-level socioeconomic data remains available throughout the modeling process regardless of the specific variables used in each model step.
This allows, for example, an equity analysis to identify the "winners" and "losers" of a proposed development without needing to encode demographic variables into each step of the model.

Ferdous et al. @ferdous_comparison_2012 compared the volume forecasts of a trip-based and activity-based model and found that the activity-based model was slightly more accurate to observed data at the region level, but about the same at the project level.
Zhong et al. @zhongComparativeAnalysisTraditional2015 found significant differences in the predictions from an ABM compared to a trip-based model, but Mouw et al. @mouwComparisonAggregatedMacroscopic2022 found that both model types had similar prediction quality.
Each of these comparisons, however, is focused on the *accuracy* of the two frameworks, but do not address the methodological differences between model types.
What types of data collection/synthesis are needed for each model type?
Are there analyses that can only be done through (or that are made easier by) one of the model types?
Though some of these questions have been discussed in the literature [@lemp_aggregate_2007], a holistic methodological comparison is lacking.

The answers in the current literature are mainly theoretical or take as a given the limitations recited by Miller [@miller_current_2023].
But technology moves quickly, and much of the existing literature comparing the two model types may be outdated.
This research aims to answer these questions by providing a side-by-side comparison using trip-based and activity-based models to represent common analysis scenarios and comparing the relative difficulty of configuration, analysis weighted against the information that can be retrieved by the methods.
