	abstract = {The current state of practice for transportation equity analysis is moving toward the use of activity-based travel models for scenario analysis. However, little has been done to validate the use of these models for equity analysis. The first objective of this paper is to present a research framework for the equity analysis of long-range transportation plans, for the purpose of critiquing the current state of practice and pointing to key research needs. This research framework is used to identify four research areas for furthering transportation equity analysis: (a) identifying transportation priorities for different groups of interest, (b) identifying appropriate modeling tools for measuring equity outcomes, (c) identifying and analyzing equity indicators, and (d) linking the equity indicators and the transportation priorities. The second objective is to explore how well an activity-based travel demand model represents heterogeneity of travel behavior among different income classes, for the purpose of transportation equity analysis. Graphical and statistical tools are used to access how well a sample of the model data compares with a sample of travel survey data for the San Francisco Bay Area in California. The results show that although the tests of distribution equality fail, the general shape of the distributions, the central tendencies, and the relative difference of the low- versus high-income samples perform well.},

“These models are desirable for equity analysis, given that the model data are disaggregate, allowing for individual level equity indicators to be calculated and distributions of these indicators to be explored.” (Bills et al., 2012, p. 18)“TransporTaTion EquiTy analysis in rEgional planning” (Bills et al., 2012, p. 18)“A common qualitative approach is to map the residential locations of minority and low-income communities in relation to the location of the proposed transportation improvement(s) and discern whether these communities are being overly exposed to transportation externalities (air or noise pollution, traffic congestion, etc.) (4–6). A predominant quantitative approach is described in the following three steps: 1. Divide the population into groups; for example, people and communities of concern can be classified by ethnicity, income level, education, and so forth. 2. Calculate equity indicators (e.g., average travel times, transit mode share, accessibility to jobs by mode) for the different groups and scenarios. 3. Compare the average or percentage changes in these measured values between the groups and scenarios (simulating changes after some transportation policy or project has been implemented).” (Bills et al., 2012, p. 19)“Several studies have used travel demand models as a platform for assessing the equity impacts of transportation projects and policies. That is, the travel demand model is used to simulate the changes in travel behavior that result from a particular transportation project or policy, and then the predominant equity analysis method described earlier is implemented. These examples include the use of aggregate four-step travel models (4, 5, 7), microsimulation travel demand models (8), activity-based travel demand models (9, 10), and integrated transportation–land use and macroeconomic models (6, 11).” (Bills et al., 2012, p. 19)(Bills et al., 2012, p. 19)“Still, there is a need to assess whether the model output represents the travel behavior differences that are important for equity analysis, including the differences between the travel behavior of high- and low-income residents. In practice, the significance of sociodemographic variables and the calibration of model parameters to match trip- and household-level characteristics are seen as sufficient for sensitivity purposes. However, for activity-based travel models, which allow for travel data to be explored at the person level, no studies were found that have sought to validate whether the model captures person-level differences between interest groups. It is also important to note that when dealing with the travel models, which are estimated and calibrated on a sample of data (on individuals and their travel patterns), this sample of data is also in question. The ability of the travel model to be sensitive to the differences between interest groups is tied to how well the sample data reflect the true characteristics of these groups. If the field is to make progress in equity analysis as an application of activity-based travel modeling, these questions must be addressed.” (Bills et al., 2012, p. 20)“This section focuses on Research Area 2 and explores the model specification and performance of a San Francisco Bay Area activity-based model (SF-CHAMP, Version 4.1, Harold) (34), for its representation of the heterogeneity of travel behavior across income groups” (Bills et al., 2012, p. 21)“Because income is a variable in the model that is both relevant and commonly used for equity analysis, this assessment uses income classes as interest groups.” (Bills et al., 2012, p. 21)“The use of the distributions of travel time indicators, by income class, builds on a common equity indicator currently used by practitioners: the change in average travel time by income class. By using the disaggregate data generated from activity-based travel models, the potential to assess distributions of travel times (or the distribution of the change in travel times for individuals) can be demonstrated by implementing a transportation plan. Additionally, there is the potential to explore how well the travel model represents the observed heterogeneity among the travel behavior of different communities of concern. The authors, however, are not suggesting that distribution shifts in travel time are the most desirable transportation equity indicator. There are a number of cases in which using such an indicator could be misleading, but it is used as an example here for its simplicity.” (Bills et al., 2012, p. 21)“This analysis points to activity-based travel models as being a reasonable tool for assessing the differences across income classes, although there are some statistical differences between the data generated from the travel model and the observed data.” (Bills et al., 2012, p. 26)

	abstract = {Information produced by travel demand models plays a large role decision making in many metropolitan areas, and San Francisco is no exception. Being a transit first city, one of the most common uses for San Francisco’s travel model SF-CHAMP is to analyze transit demand under various circumstances. SF-CHAMP v 4.1 (Harold) is able to capture the effects of several aspects of transit provision including headways, stop placement, and travel time. However, unlike how auto level of service in a user equilibrium traffic assignment is responsive to roadway capacity, SF-CHAMP Harold is unable to capture any benefit related to capacity expansion, crowding’s effect on travel time nor or any of the real-life true capacity limitations. The failure to represent these elements of transit travel has led to significant discrepancies between model estimates and actual ridership. Additionally it does not allow decision-makers to test the effects of policies or investments that increase the capacity of a given transit service. This paper presents the framework adopted into a more recent version of SF-CHAMP (Fury) to represent transit capacity and crowding within the constraints of our current modeling software.},

This paper presents a case study of a TRANSIMS Microsimulator calibration and validation using an experimental design approach. An urban arterial network consisted of four signalized intersections was calibrated against field measured travel times and traffic count data. The distributions of travel times and traffic count obtained from the multiple replications of the default parameter values were not able to replicate field conditions, while the proposed approach did well. Even though this case study used a small corridor network in urban area, the calibration and validation procedure could be extended to a larger scale network in TRANSIMS modeling as well as transportation planning applications.},

	abstract = {Urban transportation systems are vulnerable to congestion, accidents, weather, special events, and other costly delays. Whereas typical policy responses prioritize reduction of delays under normal conditions to improve the efficiency of urban road systems, analytic support for investments that improve resilience (defined as system recovery from additional disruptions) is still scarce. In this effort, we represent paved roads as a transportation network by mapping intersections to nodes and road segments between the intersections to links. We built road networks for 40 of the urban areas defined by the U.S. Census Bureau. We developed and calibrated a model to evaluate traffic delays using link loads. The loads may be regarded as traffic-based centrality measures, estimating the number of individuals using corresponding road segments. Efficiency was estimated as the average annual delay per peak-period auto commuter, and modeled results were found to be close to observed data, with the notable exception of New York City. Resilience was estimated as the change in efficiency resulting from roadway disruptions and was found to vary between cities, with increased delays due to a 5\% random loss of road linkages ranging from 9.5\% in Los Angeles to 56.0\% in San Francisco. The results demonstrate that many urban road systems that operate inefficiently under normal conditions are nevertheless resilient to disruption, whereas some more efficient cities are more fragile. The implication is that resilience, not just efficiency, should be considered explicitly in roadway project selection and justify investment opportunities related to disaster and other disruptions.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this doctoral study is to advance the state of the art of the simulation and modeling of transportation systems by addressing some of the limitations of state-of-the-practice models such as the inability to deal with large amounts of data in real-time, the aggregate nature of the majority of models, the lack of network realism in driving simulation and human behavior realism in traffic simulation, and finally the inability to evaluate new and emerging Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) applications. Within this broader research area, the work is divided into five tightly-connected research sub-topics. Subtopic 1 aims at developing and validating a novel forecasting paradigm named SPN to forecast traffic data, so as to provide an efficient and effective way for online traffic simulation and modeling. The SPN provides higher predictive accuracy and requires dramatically less processing time compared with existing approaches. Subtopic 2 develops a large-scale agent-based simulation model and validates it. The research demonstrates the feasibility of regional agent-based simulations while depending upon data readily available. Subtopic 3 proposes a semi-heuristic algorithm for estimating dynamic travel demand for large-scale simulation models. The algorithm manages to match the simulated traffic volumes to field counts while keeping the estimated Origin-Destination (OD) matrices close to the true ones. Subtopic 4 integrates a traffic simulator with a driving simulator to allow for human-in-the-loop simulation. The integrated simulator successfully shows differences in emissions levels among drivers with different years of driving experience. Finally, Subtopic 5 designs and implements an integrated IntelliDrive simulation testbed, and uses this testbed for the simulation and evaluation of an application named intelligent intersection. The research demonstrates the mobility enhancement and environmental benefits of the application, as well as the advantages of using the testbed to design and evaluate IntelliDrive applications. The aforementioned contributions of this dissertation advance the state of the art in transportation simulation and modeling, broaden the range of transportation issues for which those models and tools can be used to address, and create a vision for a human-oriented, integrated, and intelligent next-generation simulation and modeling system.},

	abstract = {The decisions of vehicular mode choice by businesses and commercial sectors in urban areas are addressed with attention to the unique trip-chaining behavior of commercial vehicles. Travel diary data from a collection of large-scale commercial vehicles in the Denver, Colorado, metropolitan area were used for analysis. Four types of travel activities were surveyed: business meetings, pickup and drop-off of people, pickup and delivery of cargo, and service calls. The survey results indicated that automobiles, pickup trucks, sport utility vehicles, single-unit trucks, and combination trucks were the main vehicular modes for travel with commercial purposes. The original survey data were sorted into trip-based and tour-based data sets for measuring commercial vehicle travel activities. A ?trip? is defined as travel from one stop to another, and a ?tour? is an entire travel journey starting from and ending at the home base of a vehicle with visits to various locations of interest. Discrete choice modeling techniques, particularly multinomial logit and nested logit models, were used to quantify the relationship between decisions on the choice of commercial vehicular mode and their affecting factors, and the two data sets were used separately. The modeling results indicate that mode choice by the commercial sector is travel specific, territory dependent, and cargo sensitive and varies by company. As proved by the comparison of trip-based and tour-based models, the tour is an intuitively and quantitatively better unit for measuring the travel activities of commercial vehicles and for modeling behavior of mode choice of the commercial sectors.},

	abstract = {This paper studies the properties and performance of a new measure of accessibility, called the activity-based accessibility (ABA) measure, and compares it to traditional measures of accessibility, including isochrone, gravity and utility-based measures. The novel aspect of the ABA is that it measures accessibility to all activities in which an individual engages, incorporating constraints such as scheduling, and travel characteristics such as trip chaining. The ABA is generated from the day activity schedule (DAS) model system, an integrated system based on the concept of an activity pattern, which identifies the sequence and tour structure among all the activities and trips taken by an individual during a day. A byproduct is an individual’s expected maximum utility over the choices of all available activity patterns, and from this the ABA is derived. The ABA is related to the logsum accessibility measures frequently derived from destination and mode discrete choice models. The key difference is that it is generated not by examining a particular trip, but by examining all trips and activities throughout the day. A case study using data from Portland, Oregon, demonstrates the rich picture of accessibility made available by use of the ABA, and highlights differences between the ABA and more traditional measures of accessibility. The ABA is successful in (a) capturing taste heterogeneity across individuals (not possible with aggregate accessibility measures), (b) combining different types of trips into a unified measure of accessibility (not possible with trip-based measures), (c) reflecting the impact of scheduling and trip chaining on accessibility (not possible with trip-based measures), and (d) quantifying differing accessibility impacts on important segments of the population such as unemployed and zero auto households (not possible with aggregate measures, and limited with trip-based measures).},

Over the last decade, many scholars have shown interest in identifying personal social networks that constitute an important source of explanation of activity-travel behaviour. This paper seeks to review two research streams: social networks and activity-travel behaviour, and social influence and travel decisions.

Over the past decade, with the advancement of data collection techniques, such as GPS, transit smart cards, and mobile phones, various types of travel trajectory data are increasingly complementing or replacing conventional travel diaries and stated preference data. Other location-aware data are used in studying human movement patterns, such as social network check-in data and banknote dispersal data. Abundance of the emerging trajectory data has driven a new wave of travel behaviour research, and introduced new research problems. This paper provides a state-of-the-art review of the travel behaviour studies categorised by trajectory data types. Based on the literature review, research challenges are discussed and promising research topics in this field are proposed for future studies.},

Despite the availability of such new Big Data sources, transport demand models used in planning practice still, almost exclusively, are based on conventional data such as travel diary surveys and population census. This literature review brings together recent advances in harnessing Big Data sources to understand travel behaviour and inform travel demand models that allow transport planners to compute what-if scenarios. From trip identification to activity inference, we review and analyse the existing data-mining methods that enable these opportunistically collected mobility traces inform transport demand models. We identify that future research should tap on the potential of probabilistic models and machine learning techniques as commonly used in data science. Those data-mining approaches are designed to handle the uncertainty of sparse and noisy data as it is the case for mobility traces derived from mobile phone data. In addition, they are suitable to integrate different related data sets in a data fusion scheme so as to enrich Big Data with information from travel diaries. In any case, we also acknowledge that sophisticated modelling knowledge has developed in the domain of transport planning and therefore we strongly advise that still, domain expert knowledge should build the fundament when applying data-driven approaches in transport planning. These new challenges call for a multidisciplinary collaboration between transport modellers and data scientists.},

Compared with traditional travel data, mobile phone data have many unique features and advantages, which attract scholars in various fields to apply them to travel behaviour research, and a certain amount of progress has been made to date. However, this is only the beginning, and mobile phone data still have great potential that needs to be exploited to further advance human mobility studies.

	abstract = {In this paper, we develop an innovative and comprehensive transport evaluation criterion to better account for equity considerations in transport project evaluation. This work explores transportation benefits from the consumer’s perspective to accessibility as a key benefit generated by any transportation project. To assess the full benefits of transportation project implementation for various consumers and calculate the improvement in accessibility, it is best to use Activity-Based Models (ABM). ABMs have two important advantages for equity analysis, which have not been utilized in the literature so far: first, ability to analyze results by various groups of the population; second, these models can utilize the Activity Based Accessibility (ABA) measure to estimate the overall benefits from transport investments and policies. The ABA measure allows one person to have different accessibilities for different choice situations, depending on his/her characteristics. We suggest including social and spatial factors in social welfare assessment by introducing the concept of accessibility gains to key social activities. Specifically, it is suggested to incorporate subjective well-being consideration into a new evaluation framework “Equity Benefit Analysis” (EBA). we use an alternative measure, “Subjective Value of Accessibility gains” (SVOA), which is based on the ABM accessibility measure as well as on Subjective Well-Being (SWB) measure, as the key benefit taken into account in the evaluation process. The SVOA is not intended to replace the current practice of analyzing equity by comparing various impacts on different groups of the population, but can aid by providing policymakers with a single measure advancingboth equity and efficiency considerations and facilitating comparison among alternatives. Initial case study results indicate the SVOA can show higher benefits to policies focusing on the needs of vulnerable social groups that compared traditional measures.},

However, these capabilities have yet to be fully explored in public practice. In this paper we first discuss a general framework for performing transportation equity analysis using activity-based travel demand models, distributional comparisons, and incorporating equity standards. In addition, we demonstrate the advantages of distributional comparisons, relative to average measures. This demonstration uses the 2000 Bay Area Travel Survey and (activity-based) mode choice model. The findings show that distributional comparisons are capable of clearly revealing the winners and losers that result from transportation improvements, in comparison with average measures. The use of these results will likely result in different conclusions on transportation investments.},

“we demonstrate the advantages of distributional comparisons, relative to average measures.” (Bills and Walker, 2017, p. 61)“These equity concerns are particularly relevant in the transportation realm. Existing conditions of inequitable transportation accessibility among society have resulted from transportation planning processes which place unfair weight on the preferences of more advantaged members of society. We are left with the reality that disadvantaged members of society have experienced less-than-fair shares of transportation benefits and disproportionately higher shares of transportation externalities.” (Bills and Walker, 2017, p. 61)“The non-modeling approach, which is more prevalent among planning organizations (Amekudzi et al., 2012), is characterized by the use of spatial analysis tools to map the residential locations of low income and minority communities in relation to the location of the proposed transportation projects. This is done to discern the level of benefits to these communities based on spatial proximity. In some cases, these analyses include determining whether the communities are being overly exposed to transportation externalities (air or noise pollution, traffic congestion, etc.) (MTC, 2001;Rodier et al., 2009 ). Our focus in this paper is on the modeling approach to equity analyses, where transportation (and land-use) scenarios are modeled using a regional travel demand model. This is to measure the expected impacts of transportation (and land-use) improvements on defined population segments and to compare these impacts (costs and/or benefits) across the segments in order to judge whether the distributions of impacts is equitable. This existing approach is summarized in the following three steps: 1. Select equity indicators (such as travel times, transit mode share, accessibility to jobs, etc.) and segment the population into two categories: target group(s) and comparison group(s). 2. Calculate indicators for the target and non-target groups. 3. Compare the changes in these measured indicators across the groups, and across scenarios (which simulate the expected changes after some transportation improvement has been made).” (Bills and Walker, 2017, p. 62)“The concern is that the mean may mask important individual level outcomes.” (Bills and Walker, 2017, p. 63)(Bills and Walker, 2017, p. 63)(Bills and Walker, 2017, p. 64)(Bills and Walker, 2017, p. 64)

	abstract = {Over the past decades, transport researchers and policy-makers have devoted increasing attention to questions about justice and equity. Nonetheless, there is still little engagement with theories in political philosophy to frame what justice means in the context of transport policies. This paper reviews key theories of justice (utilitarianism, libertarianism, intuitionism, Rawls’ egalitarianism, and Capability Approaches (CAs)) and critically evaluates the insights they generate when applied to transport. Based on a combination of Rawlsian and CAs, we propose that distributive justice concerns over transport disadvantage and social exclusion should focus primarily on accessibility as a human capability. This means that, in policy evaluation, a detailed analysis of the distributional effects of transport policies should take account of the setting of minimum standards of accessibility to key destinations and the extent to which these policies respect individuals’ rights and prioritise disadvantaged groups, reduce inequalities of opportunities, and mitigate transport externalities. A full account of justice in transportation requires a more complete understanding of accessibility than traditional approaches have been able to deliver to date.},

	abstract = {It is common knowledge that travelers often choose clusters or groups of nearby destinations that can be visited conveniently in a single tour. This propensity is becoming increasingly important in the context of rising fuel costs. However, gravity models, as well as most destination choice models, ignore these agglomeration effects and treat each trip or destination choice as independent. Some models have captured economies of agglomeration related to trip chaining through the use of accessibility variables. Accessibility variables, however, generally do not identify trip chaining effects uniquely, but measure differential spatial competition that arises because nearby destinations are generally better substitutes than distant ones. Because spatial competition effects generally dominate trip chaining agglomeration effects, models with a single accessibility variable have been called competing destinations models following Fotheringham. This paper presents an advance on Fotheringham's approach by introducing two distinct accessibility variables to represent agglomeration and spatial competition among destinations separately rather than their net effect. These new agglomerating and competing destination choice models were applied in Knoxville, Tennessee. The new models, which outperformed both gravity and competing destinations models, began to present a new alternative to activity-based models by allowing the incorporation of some of the most important trip chaining effects in trip-based travel demand models. For example, a sensitivity test showed that a new factory employing 1,000 workers would attract 125 new nonwork trips to the surrounding area on an average day as a result of stops on the way to and from work.},
