# Scenario 3: Work From Home

We will model more people working from home.

It is not obvious what the best method is; here are articles about it.

How we modeled it...

For the WFRC model, we will probably just decrease the trip rates.
It's not exactly clear by how much, but we can estimate it based on... (possibly articles doing a similar thing, maybe WFRC itself has data).
We probably also will have to increase the HBO trip rates since WFH increases discretionary trips.
We also may need to adjust the trip length distribution curves, since WFH propensity is a function of distance (we think, <citation>).

For Activitysim, we probably will generate a random number for each worker, and based on the type of job they have they also have a certain probability of WFH.
If they WFH, then they make no work tours, and maybe more discretionary tours.
If they would have made 2+ work tours, then maybe they make 1 fewer work tour.
