# Scenario 3: Work From Home

With the onset of the COVID 19 pandemic, there were unprecedented numbers of people working from home [@bick_work_2021]. This scenario is an attempt to model an increase in people working from home, or telecommuting. 
There has been much research , especially in recent years, on the implications of telecommuting *cite??*.
While many MPOs have adjusted their models to account for telecommuting, and most models follow similar principles, it is not obvious what the best method is. 
@bramberga_teleworking_2023 even stated that considerations for teleworking should be on a case by case basis because there is no single approach.
Here are some articles about it, and some of the principles we followed. *cite*
1. adjusting the number of HBW trips and NHBW trips to account for telecommuting. 
2. Using job type to determine how much to adjust the trips. 

How we modeled it...
For the trip-based model, we used data that gave a telecommute rate for a variety of different job types in each county in Utah.
To account for an increase in telecommuting, we added a multiplier in order to produce proportionately higher telecommuting rates for each job category.
These rates were used to designate a certain number of the generated HBW and NHBW trips as telecommute trips.
During trip distribution, the model saw each telecommute trip as a trip that didn't need to be part of the distribution.  

For the WFRC model, we will probably just decrease the trip rates.
It's not exactly clear by how much, but we can estimate it based on... (possibly articles doing a similar thing, maybe WFRC itself has data).
We probably also will have to increase the HBO trip rates since WFH increases discretionary trips.
We also may need to adjust the trip length distribution curves, since WFH propensity is a function of distance (we think, <citation>).

For Activitysim, we probably will generate a random number for each worker, and based on the type of job they have they also have a certain probability of WFH.
If they WFH, then they make no work tours, and maybe more discretionary tours.
If they would have made 2+ work tours, then maybe they make 1 fewer work tour.


## Factors to consider
### Less HBW trips are created (or a percentage of the HWB trips that are created don't happen)
When people telework in the sweden study, they had less trips and less VMT. Splitting it into poeple that work from home all day or only part of the day made a difference. People that worked from home part of the day had more trips and more VMT. Also, people that telecommute the whole day are more likely to use active transport. @ellder_telework_2020
### More HBO trips for leisure or more errands throughout the day
Behavioral changes on telecommuting days can cause people to travel more on the days they arenâ€™t working. Making more HBOth trips. Called a rebound effect. This was a study in Korea. @kim_is_2017
Another study also shows that work from home produces more VMT on the days they don't commute to work. @zhu_impact_2014

### People are willing to live farther from their work (so longer HBW trips will be made. different Trip Length Frequency Distribution)
Moekel did this in his study. He used probability to work-from-home to asses relevance in find housing near work. Also talks a bit about the rebound effect. @moeckel_working_2017
### People with higher paying jobs have a higher likelyhood of working from home. this might not be something we put into the model, but it could be something we look for.
