# WFH {#sec-wfh}

Third scenario models WFH.

Uses WFRC projections from 2050.

Show plot of some kind showing increase from 2019 to 2050.

## Create scenario

WFRC needs only to move 2050 data to 2019 for TC% and HBJ (in SE file ***ask Kamryn if we did this part***).

```{r}
#| label: tbl-wfrc-telecommute-years
#| tbl-cap: wfrc telecommute data

targets::tar_read(wfrc_telecommute_table) %>% 
  left_join(targets::tar_read(job_code_translation)) %>% 
  mutate(across(
    c(wfrc_2019, wfrc_2050),
    \(x) scales::label_percent(accuracy = 0.01)(x))) %>% 
  kbl(
    booktabs = TRUE,
    align = "c",
    col.names = c("Job Type", "2019", "2050")
  ) %>% 
  add_header_above(c(" ", "WFRC Model Telecommute Proportion" = 2)) %>% 
  kable_styling()
```

Asim is the same as calibration for the baseline scenario, but with different target %s.
List these.
(table of %s and coefficients for 2019/2050 side-by-side?)
