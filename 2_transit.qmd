# Scenario 2: Transit

The FrontRunner is a commuter rail line between Provo and Ogden, Utah, with several stops in-between.
Currently, for much of the line there is only one set of tracks, and train crossings are only possible near stations.
Because of this, headways are quite large, with trains running every half-hour in peak periods and hourly in off-peak periods.
Additionally, trains occasionally need to wait for each other in order to cross paths.

There is a planned improvement to the FrontRunner that would "double-track" the entire route, allowing trains to pass each other at any point.
This would allow for much smaller headways, which are currently planned at 15 and 30 minutes for peak and off-peak periods respectively.
The improvement would also partially electrify the FrontRunner, which would allow for faster travel speeds.
*elaborate; table/figure?*

In order to model this scenario we adjusted both the headways and speed parameters for the FrontRunner line.
This is straightforward for both models, as transit data is a direct input in each.
*is this true for activitysim? do we need to run the skims instead and use those? also, in cube we need to adjust the network speeds on each link, need to figure out how to do that.*
