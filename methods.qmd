This research seeks to compare methodological differences between trip- and activity-based modeling frameworks.
For this, the \acr{WFRC} travel demand model is used as a representative trip-based model, and an ActivitySim implementation in the same study area is used as a representative \acr{ABM}.
Note that the focus is not on comparing model accuracy or performance, but rather on comparing the process of using each model, including the types of analyses that can be performed.
Because of this, there are few direct comparisons of model outputs between each type.
Instead, this research highlights the strengths and weaknesses of each model type in planning and policy analysis, and illustrates these differences.

The following sections discuss the specific models in more detail.

## WFRC Model

The \acr{WFRC} model is implemented in the CUBE software by Bentley [@bentley_systems_cube], and is currently used by \acr{WFRC} for modeling travel in the Salt Lake City, Utah area.
\acr{WFRC} provided the model directly, including land use forecasts and the current long-range transportation plan.
The model is taken essentially as-is, with no changes other than those notes in Chapters [-@sec-landuse]--[-@sec-wfh].

The \acr{WFRC} model, like many trip-based models, requires the following inputs:

-   **Land use data.** This includes information about population, employment, and socioeconomic variables such as income, delineated by \acr{TAZ}. In our case this was provided by \acr{WFRC} directly, as an output of their land use forecasting model(s).
-   **Travel skims.** These detail travel time, cost, etc. between each origin-destination pair of \acr{TAZ}s. The \acr{WFRC} model uses an iterative process of assigning volumes to the transportation network and recalculating the skims, which are used in the mode and destination choice model steps.
-   **Transportation networks.** These include highway, transit, etc.Â networks which connect the \acr{TAZ}s to each other. These networks contain information such as link speed and capacity. Though the \acr{WFRC} model assigns travel volumes to the network, this research does not compare the model's network assignment results. However, the network volumes are still used to calculate the loaded network skims.
-   **Model constants and coefficients.** Many model steps, including mode choice, require calibration constants and coefficients. These are taken directly from the \acr{WFRC} model without modification.

Like many trip-based models, the WFRC model follows the "four-step" approach and has main steps of trip generation, trip distribution, mode choice, and network assignment.
The model also includes a disaggregation step at the beginning where the TAZ-level data is used via lookup tables to estimate the number of households by size, income group, number of workers, and auto ownership.
The trip generation step uses lookup tables for each household type to determine the number of trips produced by purpose.
Trip attractions are determined based on the number of jobs in each TAZ, with differing coefficients by job type.
Trip distribution uses a gravity model of the form\
$$
T_{ij} = P_i \times \frac{A_j  F_{ij}}{\displaystyle \sum_J A_j  F_{ij}},
$$\
where $T_{ij}$ is the number of trips from zone $i$ to $j$, $P_i$ is the productions at $i$, $A_j$ is the attractions at $j$, $F_{ij}$ is the cost term/function from $i$ to $j$, and $J$ is the set of all zones trips from $i$ can be attracted to.
Mode choice uses....
Network assignment is done to equalize travel time between potential routes

The WFRC model outputs include trip tables by purpose, mode, and time of day, as well as loaded network skims.

## ActivitySim

ActivitySim is an open-source \acr{ABM} led by a consortium of transportation planning agencies.
ActivitySim is highly configurable, and many agencies have their own bespoke implementation.
This research uses an ActivitySim implementation based on @macfarlane2021, which is in turn based on the prototype configuration for the Metropolitan Transportation Commission serving the San Francisco area [@cite].

ActivitySim requires similar inputs to the \acr{WFRC} model, though it does not assign traffic and so does not require any transportation networks.
Additionally, ActivitySim requires population data at an individual level, including information such as age, household income, and home location.
Due to privacy concerns, real data is rarely used for this purpose, and a synthetic population representative of the study area is used instead.
@sec-populationsim discusses the population used in this research.

ActivitySim, like all ABMs, simulates transportation decisions on an individual level.
ActivitySim has a hierarchical decision tree, where long-term decisions (such as auto ownership and telecommute frequency) are made first, followed by daily and tour- and trip-level decisions such as scheduling and mode choice (see @fig-asim-flowchart).
Each of these steps determines information that will be used in subsequent steps.
Many of these can be turned on or off depending on what is needed for the model implementation.

![ActivitySim sub-model flowchart. Long-term decisions are made first, followed by more granular ones.](images/abmexample.jpg){#fig-asim-flowchart fig-scap="ActivitySim sub-model flowchart."}

The steps can broadly be categorized into five groups, as shown in @fig-asim-flowchart.
These are aggregate, household/personal, daily, tour-level, and trip-level.
The aggregate steps mainly involve determining impedance measures between each pair of zones (travel time, distance, cost, etc.).
In this case, these impedances are supplied directly as network skims, output from the \acr{WFRC} model.

The household/personal steps relate to long-term decisions that are unlikely to change quickly based on daily transportation conditions.
These steps include determining remote work status, work/school location, auto ownership, transit pass ownership, and free parking availability at work.
Much of this information can be supplied directly or explicitly modeled.
This implementation does not supply any of this information directly, and explicitly models remote work status, work/school location, auto ownership, and free parking availability.
Transit pass ownership is not modeled.

The daily decisions primarily concern an individual's \acr{DAP}.
ActivitySim contains a step to assign mandatory, non-mandatory, and joint tours based on personal and household information (joint tours combine both mandatory and non-mandatory activities).
For example, full-time workers are more likely to make a mandatory tour than part-time workers, all else being equal.

Once a \acr{DAP} is chosen, ActivitySim creates tours for each major activity in the day.
Additionally, ActivitySim determines if an individual makes an "at-work" tour (e.g. leaving for lunch and returning to the workplace).
Each tour is scheduled and assigned a primary mode, as well as a primary destination for non-mandatory and joint tours.
The tours are then populated with trips, and ActivitySim assigns each trip a purpose, destination, time of day, and mode compatible with the tour-level assignment.

The final steps of ActivitySim are writing the trip matrices and other tables, including information on land use, persons, households, tours, and trips.
This can also include writing summary tables of the above information.

### PopulationSim {#sec-populationsim}

This research uses PopulationSim [@cite] to create a synthetic population for ActivitySim.
The synthetic population aims to be representative of the study area while maintaining privacy.
PopulationSim takes as input a "seed" of individuals and households, and populates the area with copies of these to match given control totals.

The seed sample comes from the \acr{ACS} \acr{PUMS}, which contains a sample of actual (anonymized) individuals and households at the \acr{PUMA} level (\acr{PUMA}s partition the United States into areas of around 100,000 people each [@census2023]).
The control totals come from two different sources: the Census and the \acr{WFRC} model.
@tbl-control-totals shows these controls as well as their geographic level and source.
PopulationSim also allows setting different weights to each control, and @tbl-control-totals gives this information as well.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-control-totals
#| tbl-cap: PopulationSim Control Totals by Geography and Source

tribble(
  ~Control, ~Geography, ~Source, ~Weight,
  "Population", "Entire Region", "Census", 5000,
  "Number of Households", "TAZ", "WFRC Model", 1000000000,
  "Household Size", "Census Tract", "Census", 10000,
  "Persons by Age Group", "Census Tract", "Census", 10000,
  "Households by Income Group", "Census Tract", "Census", 500,
  "Workers per Household", "Census Tract", "Census", 1000
) %>% 
  mutate(Weight = scales::label_comma()(Weight)) %>% 
  kbl(booktabs = TRUE, linesep = "", align = "lccr") %>%
  kable_styling()
```

Most of these controls come from Census data, with only the number of households per \acr{TAZ} coming from the \acr{WFRC} model data.
Note also that there are many personal and household variables that are not accounted for in these controls, such as sex, vehicle ownership, internet access, etc.
These are not controlled for and are dependent on which seed persons or households are copied in controlling for the other variables.
However, this is assumed to still give a representative enough estimate for the uncontrolled variables without needing to model them explicitly.

The outputs of PopulationSim include a persons and households table comprising the synthetic population, as well as summary tables.

## Initial Model Comparison/Calibration

While this research does not directly compare the outputs of ActivitySim to those of the \acr{WFRC} model, it is important to ensure similar performance between the two models for meaningful analyses.
As such, a baseline scenario in both models is used in order to calibrate the ActivitySim implementation to the \acr{WFRC} model.
This baseline scenario uses the 2019 \acr{WFRC} model as-is.
For ActivitySim, the baseline scenario uses 2019 Census and WFRC data to create the synthetic population, and the choice models use land use data and network skims from the baseline \acr{WFRC} scenario.

### Verification of the Synthetic Population

The controls for PopulationSim mostly come from the Census, as can be seen in @tbl-control-totals.
However, the \acr{WFRC} model contains TAZ-level data including population and median income.
The WFRC model also has a disaggregation step that estimates the number of households by size, income group, and number of workers.
This section compares the output of PopulationSim to the \acr{WFRC} model on each of these variables at the TAZ level.

@fig-population-comparison shows the difference in TAZ population between PopulationSim and the \acr{WFRC} data.
It is worth noting that since the number of households was controlled at the TAZ level from the \acr{WFRC} data with an extremely high weight, the number of households per TAZ in the synthetic population match exactly to the \acr{WFRC} data.
The average household size will therefore follow a similar error distribution to the one shown in @fig-population-comparison.

```{r}
#| label: fig-population-comparison
#| fig-cap: population comparison

targets::tar_read(pop_comp_map)
```

The population per TAZ is similar to the WFRC data in most places.
There are some discrepancies near Herriman and Lehi, but most other places are within a few percent.
Since total population is a region-level control, but number of households is a TAZ-level control, this shows PopulationSim is predicting a smaller average household size in Herriman and Lehi (and some other places) than the WFRC data suggests.
This may be reasonable, as these are suburban areas which are likely to have larger household sizes on average than places like Salt Lake City.

Income is also an important factor in travel behavior [@cite?], and @fig-median-income-comparison shows a TAZ-level comparison of median income between the synthetic population and the WFRC data.
The synthetic population does have a lower median income than the WFRC data in many TAZs, but the error is in most cases fairly small, especially in more populated areas.
However, both the WFRC model and ActivitySim use household income *groups* rather than individual household income to inform travel decisions.
These groups are taken from the WFRC model (see @tbl-income-groups), and the groups in PopulationSim and ActivitySim were adjusted to match.
@fig-income-group-map shows the difference in number of households by income group, and this shows a similar trend of PopulationSim over-predicting low-income households.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-income-groups
#| tbl-cap: income groups

targets::tar_read(income_groups) %>% 
  select(group, inc_range) %>% 
  rename("Income Group" = group, "Income Range" = inc_range) %>% 
  kbl(align = 'cr', booktabs = TRUE, linesep = "") %>% 
  kable_styling()
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-median-income-comparison
#| fig-cap: med inc

targets::tar_read(med_inc_map)
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-income-group-map
#| fig-cap: inc groups

targets::tar_read(inc_groups_map)
```

Income was not weighted very heavily as a control in PopulationSim, and this is in part why there are discrepancies between the models.
However, the overall distribution of income is similar between the models, as @fig-median-income-density shows.
A production-ready synthetic population would match its income distribution more closely to the existing WFRC model, but for the purposes of this research the income distribution is similar enough.

```{r}
#| label: fig-median-income-density
#| fig-cap: inc density

targets::tar_read(inc_comp_plot)
```

<!-- ***Comparison of number of workers?*** -->

### Verification and Calibration of ActivitySim

This section compares the outputs of both models to verify that trip patterns roughly agree between them.
This section discusses three comparisons of interest between the outputs of the two models: mode split, \acr{TLFD}, and remote work.

The initial baseline ActivitySim scenario predicted a mode split significantly different to that from the WFRC model, and so calibration efforts were needed.
The most straightforward adjustments to make in ActivitySim's mode choice model are to the alternative-specific constants.
These were adjusted iteratively based on the difference in mode shares between the two models.
@tbl-mode-split compares the mode split of both models after several iterations of this calibration.
Overall, this calibration is okay, though there are still discrepancies (e.g. ActivitySim is predicting about twice as many transit trips as the WFRC model).
However, further adjustment of the constants would cause their values to become unreasonably large, as ActivitySim's mode split begins converging at this point regardless of the calibration constant values (see @fig-calibration-plot).
This is likely due to the mode choice coefficients being unrepresentative of the study area.
This ActivitySim configuration is ultimately based on the San Francisco area, and so coefficients on variables such as travel time and income are calibrated for that area (hence in part why there are so many more transit trips).

```{r}
#| label: tbl-mode-split
#| tbl-cap: mode split
#| cache: false

targets::tar_read(mode_split_comp) %>% 
  kbl(
    booktabs = TRUE,
    col.names = c("Purpose", "Mode", "ActivitySim predicted trips", "WFRC predicted trips", "% Error", "% Error (scaled to WFRC predicted trips)"),
    digits = c(0,0,0,0,1,1),
    align = "c"
  ) %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = "scale_down") %>%
  column_spec(3, "3cm") %>%
  column_spec(4, "3.5cm") %>%
  column_spec(6, "3.7cm") %>%
  collapse_rows(1, valign = "middle", latex_hline = "major")
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-calibration-plot
#| fig-cap: calibration plot

targets::tar_read(calibration_plot)
```

@fig-tlfd-comp compares the trip length frequency distribution of the two models by mode and purpose.
Both ActivitySim and the WFRC model contain destination choice models which can be adjusted to affect the distribution of trip length.
However, as the figure shows, the two models have similar TLFDs, so no adjustment was necessary.
The most significant discrepancies are with transit trips, again likely due to this configuration of ActivitySim being calibrated to San Francisco, making transit more attractive.
Note that though these distributions match well enough for the purposes of this research, further calibration would be required to create a production-ready ActivitySim implementation.

```{r}
#| label: fig-tlfd-comp
#| fig-cap: tlfd comparison

targets::tar_read(tlfd_comp_plot)
```

The WFRC model has basic support for predicting telecommuting and work-from-home trips.
This includes a lookup table of telecommute percentages based on job type and year.
ActivitySim also has this functionality, and can additionally use individual- and household-level variables in its predictions.
It is worth noting that both the WFRC model and ActivitySim make a distinction between "telecommuting", where an individual commutes to work some days and does not others, and "work-from-home" (or "home-based jobs" in the WFRC model), where an individual's workplace is always at their home.

Both models treat "work-from-home"/"home-based jobs" similarly.
The WFRC model's land use data contains employment by type in each TAZ, and it considers a "home-based job" as a separate job type, so these are not counted toward employment totals in trip generation and subsequent steps.
ActivitySim has a "work from home" submodel which assigns workers work-from-home status based on personal variables such as income, sex, and education (coefficients on these variables were left unchanged from the existing configuration).
There is also a "target work-from-home percent" value that adjusts the model to reach the specified work-from-home proportion of all workers.
Individuals with work-from-home status are then prohibited from making a mandatory tour.
@fig-wfrc-wfh shows the distribution of home-based job percentage by TAZ in the WFRC land use data.
A weighted average of `r targets::tar_read(wfrc_hbj_base_pct)` is taken to be the target percent value for ActivitySim, and there are no other adjustments to the ActivitySim work-from-home submodel.

```{r}
#| label: fig-wfrc-wfh
#| tbl-cap: wfrc wfh data

targets::tar_read(wfrc_hbj_base_plot)
```

The two models differ in their approach to telecommuting, however.
The WFRC model has a lookup table of telecommuting shares based on job type (see @tbl-baseline-telecommute), including predictions for future years.
ActivitySim has a "telecommute frequency" submodel which assigns workers a telecommute status indicating the number of days they work remotely per week.
Based on this status, the model adjusts the likelihood of making a mandatory tour.
Telecommute status depends on personal variables similar to those in the work-from-home submodel by default.
In order to calibrate to the WFRC data, however, there are additional job type variables added to match those given in @tbl-baseline-telecommute.
Because these are choice coefficients rather than target percentages, the values needed to be calibrated to match the WFRC targets.
The calibration allowed ActivitySim to match these targets exactly without the coefficients becoming too large, and the coefficients are given in @tbl-baseline-telecommute.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-baseline-telecommute
#| tbl-cap: wfrc telecommute data

targets::tar_read(compare_tc_2019) %>% 
  mutate(wfrc_2019 = scales::label_percent(accuracy = 0.01)(wfrc_2019)) %>% 
  rename(
    "Job Type" = name,
    "WFRC Telecommute Proportion" = wfrc_2019
    ) %>% 
  kbl(
    booktabs = TRUE,
    align = "c"
  ) %>% 
  add_header_above(c(" ", " ", "ActivitySim Telecommute Utility Coefficients" = 3)) %>% 
  kable_styling()
```

## Example Scenarios

There are three proposed scenarios to implement and run in each model for comparison.
These are a sample of the types of planning and development that agencies would like to model.
This is not a comprehensive list covering all potential scenario possibilities, but is taken to represent many of the types of scenarios an agency would analyze.

The first scenario involves a change in land use near the former state prison site in Draper, Utah.
Current plans for this site involve new development known as "The Point", which will add high-density housing and commercial development to the area.
<!-- @fig-landuse-site-imagery shows imagery of the site. --> This research scenario will be based on this development, but will include only the land use changes.
The actual development plans also include expansion of transit, but this will not be a part of this scenario.

The second scenario centers around an augmentation of transit service along the Wasatch Front.
The FrontRunner, a \acr{CRT} line connecting Provo to Ogden, is slated for expansion.
This scenario models an increase in the speed and frequency of FrontRunner trains and adds several stations along its route, in accordance with the planned expansion of the service.
<!-- @fig-frontrunner-beforeafter -->

The third scenario addresses the growing trend of remote work.
Given technological advancements and the notable surge in remote work during the COVID-19 pandemic, this scenario models a substantial increase in remote work based on projections from WFRC.
<!-- @fig-wfh-projections -->

Each of these scenarios is based on the baseline 2019 scenario in each model.
Only the noted changes are made, ignoring any additional growth or infrastructure development that is expected.
For example, the increased \acr{WFH} scenario uses \acr{WFH} projections from 2050, but land use and socioeconomic data from 2019.
These scenarios are therefore not realistic, but they serve as illustrative examples of the types of planning and development scenarios agencies may wish to analyze.

All three of these scenarios are coded in both the \acr{WFRC} model and the ActivitySim implementation used.
The results (Chapters [-@sec-landuse]--[-@sec-wfh]) describe the process of coding each scenario and analyzing them, as well as the analyses themselves.
