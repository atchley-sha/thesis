# Methodology {#sec-methods}

This section lists our methodology.

We will compare models...

We will forecast several scenarios.

## Models to Use

WFRC Model, where it is from, etc.

ActivitySim, where it is from, etc.

We are getting the input zonal SE data form the WFRC model and using that as targets for our synthetic population generation (via PopulationSim).

Model inputs/outputs diagram?

We will model the following scenarios:
- Land use
- Transit
- WFH

## Computational resources?

Describe BEAST and the BYU Supercomputer.
