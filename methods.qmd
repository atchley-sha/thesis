# Methods

We are comparing TBMs to ABMs.

We will forecast several specific scenarios and get an idea of computing resources.

## Scenarios

The first scenario is change in land use.

The second scenario is increased transit service.

The third scenario is increased WFH.

All three of these scenarios will be coded in both a representative TBM and ABM.

## WFRC Model

The \acr{WFRC} model is implemented in the CUBE software by Bentley [@bentley_systems_cube], and is currently used by \acr{WFRC} for modeling travel in the Salt Lake City, Utah area.
\acr{WFRC} provided the model directly, including land use forecasts and the current long-range transportation plan.
The model is taken mostly as-is, though some changes were made to better accommodate the different scenarios.
These modifications are noted in more detail in their respective sections.

The \acr{WFRC} model, like many trip-based models, requires the following inputs:

-   **Land use data.** This includes information about population, employment, and socioeconomic variables such as income, delineated by \acr{TAZ}. In our case this was provided by \acr{WFRC} directly, as an output of their land use forecasting model(s).
-   **Travel skims.** This details travel time, cost, etc. between each origin-destination pair of \acr{TAZ}s. The \acr{WFRC} model uses an iterative process of assigning volumes to the transportation network and recalculating the skims, which are used in the mode and destination choice model steps.
-   **Transportation networks.** These includes highway, transit, etc. networks which connect the \acr{TAZ}s to each other. These networks contain information such as link speed and capacity. Though the \acr{WFRC} model assigns travel volumes to the network, this research does not compare the model's network assignment results. However, the network volumes are still used to calculate the loaded network skims.
-   **Model constants and coefficients.** Many model steps, including mode choice, require calibration constants and coefficients. These are taken directly from the \acr{WFRC} model without modification.

How the model works; enumerate and describe each step.

## ActivitySim

ActivitySim is an open-source \acr{ABM} led by a consortium of transportation planning agencies.
ActivitySim is highly configurable, and many agencies have their own bespoke implementation.
This research uses an ActivitySim implementation based on @macfarlane2021, which is in turn based on the prototype configuration for the Metropolitan Transportation Commission serving the San Francisco area [@cite].

ActivitySim requires similar inputs to the \acr{WFRC} model, though it does not assign traffic and so does not require any transportation networks.
Additionally, ActivitySim requires population data at an individual level, including information such as household income, age, and home location.
Due to privacy concerns, real data is rarely used for this purpose, and a synthetic population representative of the study area is used instead.
@sec-populationsim discusses the population used in this research.

ActivitySim, like all ABMs, simulates transportation decisions on an individual level.
ActivitySim has a hierarchical decision tree, where long-term decisions (such as auto ownership and telecommute frequency) are made first, followed by daily and tour- and trip-level decisions such as scheduling and mode choice (see @fig-asim-flowchart).
Each of these steps determines information that will be used in subsequent steps.
Most of these can be turned on or off depending on what is needed for the model implementation.

![ActivitySim sub-model flowchart. Long-term decisions are made first, followed by more granular ones.](images/abmexample.jpg){#fig-asim-flowchart fig-scap="ActivitySim sub-model flowchart."}

The steps can broadly be categorized into five groups, as shown in @fig-asim-flowchart.
These are aggregate, household/personal, daily, tour-level, and trip-level.
The aggregate steps mainly involve determining impedance measures between each pair of zones (travel time, distance, cost, etc.).
In this case, these impedances are supplied directly as network skims, output from the \acr{WFRC} model.

The household/personal steps relate to long-term decisions that are unlikely to change quickly based on daily transportation conditions.
These steps include determining remote work status, work/school location, auto ownership, transit pass ownership, and free parking availability at work.
Much of this information can be supplied directly or explicitly modeled.
This implementation does not supply any of this information directly, and explicitly models remote work status, work/school location, auto ownership, and free parking availability.
Transit pass ownership is not modeled.

The day-level decisions primarily concern an individual's \acr{DAP}.
ActivitySim contains a step to assign mandatory, joint, and non-mandatory tours based on personal and household information (joint tours combine both mandatory and non-mandatory activities).
For example, full-time workers are more likely to make a mandatory tour than part-time workers, all else being equal.
***one more sentence?***

Once a \acr{DAP} is chosen, ActivitySim creates tours for each major activity in the day.
Additionally, ActivitySim determines if an individual makes an "at-work" tour (e.g. leaving for lunch and returning to the workplace).
Each tour is scheduled and assigned a primary mode, as well as a primary destination for non-mandatory and joint tours.
The tours are then populated with trips, and ActivitySim assigns each trip an origin, destination, time, mode, etc. compatible with the tour-level assignment.

The final steps of ActivitySim are writing the trip matrices and other tables including information on land use, persons, households, tours, and trips.
This can also include writing summary tables of the above information.
