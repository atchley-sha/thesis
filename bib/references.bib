  abstract = {This paper describes the conceptual development, operatonalization and empirical testing of Albatross: A Learning-based Transportation Oriented Simulation System. This activity-based model of activity-travel behavior is derived from theories of choice heuristics that consumers apply when making decisions in complex environments. The model, one of the most comprehensive of its kind, predicts which activities are conducted when, where, for how long, with whom, and the transport mode involved. In addition, various situational, temporal, spatial, spatial-temporal and institutional constraints are incorporated in the model. The decision tree is proposed as a formalism to represent an exhaustive set of mutually exclusive rules for each decision step in the model. A CHAID decision tree induction method is used to derive decision trees from activity diary data. The case study conducted to develop and test the model indicates that performance of the model is very satisfactory. We conclude therefore that the methodology proposed in this article is useful to develop computational process models of activity-travel choice behavior.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the representation of the activity planning process utilized in a new activity-based microsimulation model called the ADAPTS (Agent-based Dynamic Activity Planning and Travel Scheduling) model, which dynamically simulates activity and travel planning and scheduling. The model utilizes a dynamic activity planning framework within the larger overall microsimulation system, which is a computational process model that attempts to replicate the decisions which comprise time-dependent activity scheduling. The model presents a step forward in which the usual concepts of activity generation and activity scheduling are significantly enhanced by adding an additional component referred to as activity planning in which the various attributes which describe the activity are determined. The model framework, therefore, separates activity planning from activity generation and treats all three components, generation, planning and scheduling, as separate discrete but dynamic events within the overall microsimulation. The development of the planning order model, which determines when and in what order each activity planning decision is made is the specific focus of this paper. The models comprising the planning order framework are developed using recent survey data from a GPS-based prompted recall survey. The model development, estimation, validation, and its use within the overall ADAPTS system are discussed. A significant finding of the study is the verification of the apparent transferability of the activity planning order model.},

Our current understanding of U.S. drivers' travel-related needs and concerns by race/ethnicity is limited. Methods Data from the 2010 HealthStyles survey, an annual, cross-sectional, national mail-panel survey of persons ages 18years or older living in the United States, were used to calculate weighted percentages of travel-related behaviors, opinions, and concerns by race/ethnicity. Logistic regression was used to explore associations between race/ethnicity and specific travel-related concerns, while adjusting for other demographic characteristics. Results Adequate transportation alternatives to driving were reported by a greater percentage of persons in certain minority groups compared to whites (Hispanic: 34.7\%; white: 23.4\%). Concern for the availability of alternatives to driving in the future was greater among minority groups (black: 57.7\%; Hispanic: 47.3\%; other: 50.9\%) compared to whites (37.5\%). Additionally, among persons with a household income of \$25,000+, minorities were generally more likely than whites to report concern about having alternative transportation options to driving, whereas concern was consistently high among all racial/ethnic groups for those earning less than \$25,000 annually. In each racial/ethnic group, more than 10\% of persons reported not knowing how they would get around if they could no longer drive. Conclusions Important variations by race/ethnicity in both travel behaviors and concerns for adequate alternatives to driving were found, revealing the need for further research to better understand reasons for these differences and to identify ways to meet the transportation needs of the changing U.S. population demographics. Impact on Industry Further research on adequate alternatives to driving and transportation needs is needed.},

This research framework is used to identify four research areas for furthering transportation equity analysis: (a) identifying transportation priorities for different groups of interest, (b) identifying appropriate modeling tools for measuring equity outcomes, (c) identifying and analyzing equity indicators, and (d) linking the equity indicators and the transportation priorities. The second objective is to explore how well an activity-based travel demand model represents heterogeneity of travel behavior among different income classes, for the purpose of transportation equity analysis. Graphical and statistical tools are used to access how well a sample of the model data compares with a sample of travel survey data for the San Francisco Bay Area in California.

In addition, we demonstrate the advantages of distributional comparisons, relative to average measures. This demonstration uses the 2000 Bay Area Travel Survey and (activity-based) mode choice model. The findings show that distributional comparisons are capable of clearly revealing the winners and losers that result from transportation improvements, in comparison with average measures.

A tour is defined as the travel from home to one or more activity locations and back home again. The activity pattern consists of important decisions that provide overall structure for the day's activities and travel. In the prototype the activity pattern includes (a) the primary -- most important -- activity of the day, with one alternative being to remain at home for all the day's activities; (b) the type of tour for the primary activity, including the number, purpose and sequence of activity stops; and (c) the number and purpose of secondary -- additional -- tours. Tour models include the choice of time of day, destination and mode of travel, and are conditioned by the choice of activity pattern. The choice of activity pattern is influenced by the expected maximum utility derived from the available tour alternatives.},

  abstract = {This study develops a model of a person's day activity schedule that can be used to forecast urban travel demand. It is motivated by the notion that travel outcomes are part of an activity scheduling decision, and uses discrete choice models to address the basic modeling problem---capturing decision interactions among the many choice dimensions of the immense activity schedule choice set. An integrated system of choice models represents a person's day activity schedule as an activity pattern and a set of tours. A pattern model identifies purposes, priorities and structure of the day's activities and travel. Conditional tour models describe timing, location and access mode of on-tour activities. The system captures trade-offs people consider, when faced with space and time constraints, among patterns that can include at-home and on-tour activities, multiple tours and trip chaining. It captures sensitivity of pattern choice to activity and travel conditions through a measure of expected tour utility arising from the tour models. When travel and activity conditions change, the relative attractiveness of patterns changes because expected tour utility changes differently for different patterns. An empirical implementation of the model system for Portland, Oregon, establishes the feasibility of specifying, estimating and using it for forecasting. Estimation results match a priori expectations of lifestyle effects on activity selection, including those of (a) household structure and role, such as for females with children, (b) capabilities, such as income, and (c) activity commitments, such as usual work levels. They also confirm the significance of activity and travel accessibility in pattern choice. Application of the model with road pricing and other policies demonstrates its lifestyle effects and how it captures pattern shifting---with accompanying travel changes---that goes undetected by more narrowly focused trip-based and tour-based systems. Although the model has not yet been validated in before-and-after prediction studies, this study gives strong evidence of its behavioral soundness, current practicality, potential to generate cost-effective predictions superior to those of the best existing systems, and potential for enhanced implementations as computing technology advances.},

  abstract = {Intra-household interactions constitute an important aspect in modeling activity and travel-related decisions. Recognition of this importance has recently produced a growing body of research on various aspects of modeling intra-household interactions and group decision-making mechanisms as well as first attempts to incorporate intra-household interactions in regional travel demand models. The previously published research works were mostly focused on time allocation aspect and less on generation of activity episodes, trips, and travel tours that are necessary units for compatibility with regional travel demand models. Also, most of the approaches were limited to household heads only and did not consider explicitly the other household members as acting agents in the intra-household decision making. A model is proposed for joint choice of daily activity pattern (DAP) types for all household members that explicitly takes into account added group-wise utilities of joint participation in the same activity. The model is based on the aggregate description of individual DAP types by three main categories -- mandatory travel pattern, non-mandatory travel pattern, and at-home pattern. Important intra-household interactions can be captured already at this aggregate level. A choice structure considers all possible combinations of DAPs of all household members as alternatives. Utility function of each alternative includes components corresponding to each individual DAP type as well as group-wise interaction terms that correspond to joint choice of the same pattern by several household members. Statistical analysis of intra-household interactions and estimation results of the choice model are presented. The model estimation has confirmed a strong added utility of joint choice of the same pattern for such person types as non-worker or part time worker in combination with child, two retired persons, two children, and others. The proposed model represents a part of the advanced regional model system being developed for the Atlanta Regional Commission.},

The result of this thesis is a simple approach of teleworking probability for trip generation in transport demand models. The method is then applied on a case study of Uppsala municipality. The main findings suggest that it is important to consider both ability and willingness to telework in transport demand models. One of the challenges in modelling teleworking, is to find data on the most basic factors that affect the probability.

  abstract = {This paper studies the properties and performance of a new measure of accessibility, called the activity-based accessibility (ABA) measure, and compares it to traditional measures of accessibility, including isochrone, gravity and utility-based measures. The novel aspect of the ABA is that it measures accessibility to all activities in which an individual engages, incorporating constraints such as scheduling, and travel characteristics such as trip chaining. The ABA is generated from the day activity schedule (DAS) model system, an integrated system based on the concept of an activity pattern, which identifies the sequence and tour structure among all the activities and trips taken by an individual during a day. A byproduct is an individual's expected maximum utility over the choices of all available activity patterns, and from this the ABA is derived. The ABA is related to the logsum accessibility measures frequently derived from destination and mode discrete choice models. The key difference is that it is generated not by examining a particular trip, but by examining all trips and activities throughout the day. A case study using data from Portland, Oregon, demonstrates the rich picture of accessibility made available by use of the ABA, and highlights differences between the ABA and more traditional measures of accessibility. The ABA is successful in (a) capturing taste heterogeneity across individuals (not possible with aggregate accessibility measures), (b) combining different types of trips into a unified measure of accessibility (not possible with trip-based measures), (c) reflecting the impact of scheduling and trip chaining on accessibility (not possible with trip-based measures), and (d) quantifying differing accessibility impacts on important segments of the population such as unemployed and zero auto households (not possible with aggregate measures, and limited with trip-based measures).},

  abstract = {Telework, long promoted as a way to reduce daily travel and address congestion problems, has been extensively studied in transport research. Empirical consensus has long held that telework reduces overall travel, but several updated studies now suggest the opposite. Meanwhile, telework has steadily increased in many countries, and few studies have examined contexts where regular teleworkers have grown to form an early majority. We study how telework influences daily travel in such a context, namely, Sweden from 2011 to 2016. Using representative micro-data from the Swedish National Travel Survey, this study also captures travel behaviour during the defined period when the telework was actually practiced, distinguishing different telework arrangements and analysing a range of travel behavioral outcomes. We conclude that telework leads to reduced travel demand, more use of active transport modes, and congestion relief. Important differences between full- and part-day teleworkers are also highlighted, stressing the importance of understanding telework as a diversified coping strategy for organizing the spatiotemporality of everyday life.},

These four dimensions were vehicle ownership, work flow distribution, work flow distribution by time of day, and average work trip travel time. The tour-based model performed better overall than the trip-based model for all four dimensions.

This paper explores whether telecommuters conduct more out-of-home activities than their non-telecommuting counterparts. More importantly, this paper investigates activity differences between low- and high-income telecommuters. This study draws a sample of approximately 7,500 workers from the 2007 Chicago Regional Household Travel Inventory. We use a Poisson model to estimate the number of out-of-home activities, and use an instrumental-variables (IV) approach to address the potential self-selection issue of telecommuting. We also identify workers who worked at home (WAH) during the survey days. Results show that telecommuting status and whether the respondents WAH on survey days affect out-of-home activities. During the survey days, low-income workers were less likely to telecommute than high-income workers, but those who actually telecommuted were similarly likely to conduct a higher number of total trips, pick-up/drop-off trips, and maintenance/discretionary trips, but fewer commute trips than the high-income telecommuters. Even on the days when telecommuters went to workplaces, telecommuting status is still associated with more trips. The behavioral difference between telecommuters and non-telecommuters on commuting days suggests that such disparity stems from unobserved differences between the two groups of workers rather than from the saved commute time through telecommuting.},

For each extension, the text provides pointers to the additional documentation and to the code base. It is also discussed how people with appropriate Java programming skills can write their own extensions, and plug them into the MATSim core.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}The project has started from the basic idea that traffic is a consequence of human behavior, and thus humans and their behavior should be the starting point of all modelling, and with the intuition that when simulations with 100 million particles are possible in computational physics, then behavior-oriented simulations with 10 million travelers should be possible in travel behavior research. The initial implementations thus combined concepts from computational physics and complex adaptive systems with concepts from travel behavior research. The third part of the book looks at theoretical concepts that are able to describe important aspects of the simulation system; for example, under certain conditions the code becomes a Monte Carlo engine sampling from a discrete choice model. Another important aspect is the interpretation of the MATSim score as utility in the microeconomic sense, opening up a connection to benefit cost analysis.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}Finally, the book collects use cases as they have been undertaken with MATSim.

The space-time activity framework described provides a general alternative basis for the study of travel behaviour. The activity-travel framework view people as living on a daily basis by participating in a sequence of activities, in order to satisfy basic needs and less essential preferences. Although undoubtedly a considerable advance, viewed from the perspective of the activity-travel framework the existing disaggregate travel demand models contain a number of fundamental limitations and appear more as a refinement of existing approaches than a radical departure from them. The Transport Studies Unit, Oxford University, have been carrying out studies of travel behaviour using the human activity approach, at both conceptual and empirical levels since late 1974.},

  abstract = {Telecommuting is regarded as a sustainable travel-demand management strategy. In investigating how much telecommuting reduces travel, studies typically adopt one method of the following three: (1) multiplying the telecommuting frequency by the round-trip commute distance, (2) measuring travel changes using quasi-experiments, and (3) determining the marginal effect of telecommuting on travel using econometric analyses. However, each approach has methodological limitations, and previous studies fail to take into consideration various aspects of household travel other than the telecommuter's commute. Against this backdrop, this study presents an alternative approach to estimating the impact of the household head's telecommuting on total household travel other than his or her commute travel using data from the 2006 Household Travel Survey in Korea. Our series of stratified tobit regression analyses show that when the household head does not commute, the usual compensatory travel mechanism induces person-kilometers traveled of 2 km. This rebound effect doubles when the household head telecommutes, although not on regular commuting days. The effect suggests that the benefits of telecommuting are significantly less than anticipated. Consequently, planners and policy makers should consider this counteracting effect when predicting the travel reduction effect of telecommuting or determining the level of telecommuting required to achieve environmental policy goals for urban sustainability.},

  abstract = {Two competing approaches to travel demand modeling exist today. The more traditional four-step travel demand models rely on aggregate demographic data at a traffic analysis zone (TAZ) level. Activity-based microsimulation methods use more robust behavioral theory while focusing on individuals and households. Although the vast majority of U.S. metropolitan planning organizations continue to rely on traditional models, many modelers believe that activity-based approaches promise greater predictive capability, more accurate forecasts, and more realistic sensitivity to policy changes. Little work has examined in detail the benefits of activity-based models relative to more traditional approaches. To understand better the trade-offs between these two methodologies, results produced by both were modeled in an Austin, Texas, application. Three scenarios are examined: a base scenario, a scenario with expanded capacity along two key freeways, and a centralized-employment scenario. Results of the analysis revealed several differences in model performance and accuracy in terms of replicating travel survey and traffic count data. Such distinctions largely emerged through differing model assumptions. In general, activity-based models were more sensitive to changes in model inputs, supporting the notion that aggregate models ignore important behavioral distinctions across the population. However, they involved more effort and care in data manipulation, model calibration, and application to mimic behavioral processes better at a finer resolution. Such efforts help ensure that synthetic populations match key criteria and that activity schedules match surveyed behaviors, while being realistic and consistent across household members.},

Even designing a system targeted at these users is challenging, given the limited prior analysis of their travel behavior and activity patterns. Simulation tools are used by cities around the world to understand novel and complex transportation systems, yet few are including the needs of users with disabilities in these simulation studies. This report examines the travel patterns of wheelchair users from the 2017 National Household Travel Survey, and presents a model of daily activity pattern choice of respondents who self-identify as using a wheelchair. This report discusses the application of a wheelchair status variable in the activity-based travel demand model ActivitySim and measures its effect on individual and household daily activity pattern choice. Wheelchair use is estimated to reduce the utility of a work daily activity pattern by 1.9 points relative to a home pattern for full-time workers and 3.4 for part-time workers. Including the effect of wheelchair use in a regional daily activity pattern model resulted in 21.9 percent of wheelchair users changing to a home activity pattern relative to a base scenario not including wheelchair use. Lastly, the report evaluates the performance of an on-demand, accessible mode for users with wheelchairs in the agent-based microsimulation BEAM. This simulation showed that demand for such a service increases linearly with fleet size and wait time remains constant, though further scenario refinement and research is necessary.},

A heuristic, or rule-based, method is used to organize activities into projects and then to form schedules for interacting household members.

Activity-based models overcome many of the limitations of the trip-based model, but implementing and calibrating an activity-based model is labor-intensive and running an activity-based model often takes long runtimes. This paper proposes a hybrid called MITO (Microsimulation Transport Orchestrator) that overcomes some of the limitations of trip-based models, yet is easier to implement than an activity-based model. MITO uses microsimulation to simulate each household and person individually. After trip generation, the travel time budget in minutes is calculated for every household. This budget influences destination choice; i.e., people who spent a lot of time commuting are less likely to do much other travel, while people who telecommute might compensate by additional discretionary travel. Mode choice uses a nested logit model, and time-of-day choice schedules trips in 1-minute intervals. Three case studies demonstrate how individuals may be traced through the entire model system from trip generation to the assignment.},

By explicitly representing a travel time budget for every household, the tendency to add non-work trips is modelled endogenously for teleworkers. A model for household relocation explicitly accounts for the travel time to work, and this constraint is loosened proportionally to the number days of telework per week.},

When weighted by telecommuting frequency, average reductions of 11.9\% in PMT and 11.5\% in VMT were found over a five-day work week. Person-trips and vehicle-trips increased slightly (but not significantly) on TC days. This was due to statistically significant increases in commute trips by telecommuters (who more often went home for lunch on their TC days), partly counteracted by decreases in non-commute travel. The drive-alone mode share increased on TC days, both for all trips, and for commute trips in particular. Walking and biking shares also increased modestly on TC days, whereas shares of transit and ridesharing declined. Despite the increase in trip rates, TC-day reductions were found for all pollutants analyzed: 15\% for total organic gas emissions, 21\% for carbon monoxide, 35\% for oxides of nitrogen, and 51\% for particulate matter. The reduction in VMT more than compensated for the marginal increase in number of trips (and consequently, cold starts) on telecommuting days.},

The objective of this paper is to incorporate travel time budgets as constraints for non-commute trips in the destination choice model, while the commute time will be given directly by home and workplace locations as defined in a synthetic population. Individual travel time budgets for every trip purpose were calculated using the household as analysis unit. The results indicate that travel time depends on the number of required trips by trip purpose and household sociodemographics. Increasing the number of trips for one purpose reduces the travel time allocated for the other trips, confirming the existence of an overall travel time budget. Household size is the most important sociodemographic variable, followed by the household income.

  abstract = {The emergence of new mobility services as a result of the societal transition from owning to using goods and services, requires travel demand models to include the decision maker's context. The traditional aggregated, macroscopic, trip-based 4-step model is not able to fulfil this requirement. Therefore, a generation of more advanced models has arrived with clear theoretical advantages. These models are disaggregated, microscopic, and tour-based, and take the decision maker's context into account. However, empirical comparisons between these two approaches are scarce and do not address the prediction quality of both models, while the primary aim of travel demand models is to forecast future situations. The presented study attempts to fill this knowledge gap by conducting a backcast: predicting a historical year for which observed travel behaviour is available and compare this with the base year performance. The city of Almere in the Netherlands between 2010 and 2017 is used as case. The model performance is evaluated using three aggregated Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that can be used for both models: trip frequency, modal split, and trip length distribution. The results demonstrate that the advanced model, called Octavius, is more capable of describing the base year compared to the 4-step model when evaluated against travel survey data. However, the backcast results show that both models perform similarly in terms of prediction quality. Hence, the longitudinal stability of both models is similar. In addition to the three KPIs, the disaggregated behaviour is analysed using two scenarios. The findings show that Octavius is able to include factors that affect travel behaviour in a manner that is consistent with literature. The 4-step model on the other hand exhibits counterintuitive results with increasing car use when car ownership decreases, which demonstrates its lack of behavioural realism. Moreover, the possibility of Octavius to model certain subgroups in society is a valuable tool to evaluate transport policies and other developments, such as the development of new neighbourhoods; analyses that the 4-step is not able to provide. Finally, the main limitation of this study is the limited differences between 2017 and 2010 in travel behaviour and socioeconomic development. Consequently, it is not possible to accurately evaluate how the models respond to changes, and in which situations one model performs better than the other. Future research could clarify this by using a longer backcast period, while ensuring that input and evaluation data are of sufficient quality.},

This paper investigates the long term impacts of this remote work experiment and what we can anticipate in the future, based on the direct impact that COVID has had on hiring, sentiments around remote work, and plans moving forward. The analysis uses two waves of survey data: one fielded prior to the pandemic in November 2019, and the other fielded during the pandemic in April 2020. The surveys polled a combined 1,500 hiring managers which includes executives, VPs, and managers- so the results reflect the views and plans of those with direct influence over businesses' remote work decisions. In short, these results provide before and after snapshots of how relevant decision makers view the remote work experiment so far and how it has affected their plans. The results suggest that the remote work experiment has gone better than expected for hiring managers. The perceived benefits of working remotely are causing businesses to significantly increase plans for remote hiring in the future, which will cause an acceleration in the already upward trend of greater remote work.},

Trip distribution---whether the trip is intrazonal (internal) or interzonal (external)---is one of the essential steps in travel demand forecasting. However, the current intrazonal forecasts based on a gravity model involve flawed assumptions, primarily due to a lack of considerations on differences in zone size, land use, and street network patterns. In this study, we first survey 25 MPOs about how they model intrazonal travel and find the state of the practice to be dominated by the gravity model. Using travel data from 31 diverse regions in the U.S., we develop an approach to enhance the conventional model by including more built environment D variables and by using multilevel logistic regression. The models' predictive capability is confirmed using k-fold cross-validation. The study results provide practical implications for state and local planning and transportation agencies with better accuracy and generalizability.},

  abstract = {The objective of this study is to contribute to the telecommuting literature by jointly examining the propensity and frequency of workers to telecommute, using a rich set of individual demographics, work-related and industry characteristics, household demographics, and commute-trip/work-location characteristics. The data are drawn from the Chicago Regional Household Travel Inventory, collected between 2007 and 2008. From a methodological standpoint, the current study adopts a copula approach that allows the testing of several types of dependency structures between the telecommuting choice and frequency behavioral processes. To our knowledge, this is the first formulation and application in the econometric literature of a copula approach for the case of a binary self-selection mechanism with an ordered-response outcome. The results clearly indicate that telecommuting choice and the frequency of telecommuting are governed by quite different underlying behavioral processes. For instance, women are less likely to telecommute relative to men, though there is no statistically significant difference in telecommuting frequency propensity between men and women telecommuters. Similarly, full-time employed individuals ({$\geq$}30 hours per week) are more likely to have a telecommuting arrangement than those working part-time ({$<$}30 hours per week). However, among those who telecommute, full-time employed individuals telecommute less frequently than part-time employed individuals. Further, the results suggest that the analyst risks the danger of incorrect conclusions regarding dependency in the telecommuting choice and frequency behavioral processes, as well as inconsistent and inefficient parameter estimates, by imposing incorrect dependency structures or assuming independence between the two behavioral processes. Overall, the empirical results indicate the important effects of several demographic and work-related variables on telecommuting choice and frequency, with implications for transportation planning and transportation policy analysis.},

  abstract = {The growing recognition of negative impacts of vehicular emissions on global warming and public health is one of the main factors that led transportation policymakers to devise congestion/pollution mitigation strategies. However, in order to attain the best perception of potential results of implementing these policies, it would be essential to understand the response of people in terms of changing their travel behaviors. Activity-based travel demand models provide comprehensive platforms to simulate individuals' travel behavior at very fine scale and examine the impact of various policies on population. This paper explores the applicability of activity-based models in evaluating the small- and large-scale environmental consequences of transportation policies. To provide a holistic and policy sensitive platform for estimating mobile source emissions, we integrate an activity-based travel demand model with a mesoscopic dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) module and a microscopic emission simulator. Accordingly, the ADAPTS model is extended with an agent-based DTA component, which allows for dynamic interaction between the demand model and network simulator. Then, the US EPA's mobile source emission model, MOVES, is leveraged to estimate emissions produced by passenger cars. The main challenge in developing such an integrated framework is compatibility of the data among its different components. The performance of this framework is analyzed through two county- and project-level case studies in Chicago metropolitan area. In the county-level analysis, the base-year replication results show a drastic rise in emissions during peak periods, that is, around 14.8\% and 27.2\% of total daily NOx emission are produced during morning and evening rush hours, respectively. Further, as the project-level analysis, a capacity improvement in a critical ramp in the network is implemented in the DTA model. The simulation results show 24\% reduction in VHT and 2.3\% increase in VMT in 10-h simulation period in that link.},

The modeling environment presented here is intended to bridge this gap by providing a palatable way for planning agencies to move toward advanced methods. Three components to bridging the gap are emphasized: an incremental approach, a demonstration of clear gains, and a provision of an environment that eases initial implementation and allows for expansion. The modeling environment (called STEP2) is a household microsimulator, developed in TransCAD, that can be used to implement a four-step model as well as models with longer-term behavior and trip chaining. An implementation for southern Nevada is described, and comparisons are made with the region's aggregate four-step model. The models perform similarly in numerous ways. A key advantage to the microsimulator is that it provides impacts by socioeconomic group (essential for equity analysis) and individual trip movements (for use in a vehicle microsimulator). A sensitivity analysis indicates that the microsimulation model has less inelastic cross elasticity of transit demand with respect to auto travel times than the aggregate model (aggregation error). The trade-off is that microsimulators have simulation error; results are presented regarding the severity of this error. This work shows that a shift to microsimulation does not necessarily require substantial investment to achieve many of the benefits. One of the greatest advantages is a flexible environment that can expand to include additional sensitivity to demographics and transportation policy variables.},

  abstract = {Activity-based travel demand modeling (ABTDM) has often been viewed as an advanced approach, due to its higher fidelity and better policy sensitivity. However, a review of the literature indicates that no study has been undertaken to investigate quantitatively the differences and accuracy between an ABTDM approach and a traditional four-step travel demand model. In this paper we provide a comparative analysis against each step -- trip generation, trip distribution, mode split, and network assignment -- between an ABTDM developed using travel diary data from the Tampa Bay Region in Florida and the Tampa Bay Regional Planning Model (TBRPM), an existing traditional four-step model for the same area. Results show salient differences between the TBRPM and the ABTDM, in terms of modeling performance and accuracy, in each of the four steps. For example, trip production rates calculated from the travel diary data are found to be either double or a quarter less than those used in the TBRPM. On the other hand, trip attraction rates computed from activity-based travel simulations are found to be either more than double or one tenth less than those used in the TBRPM. The trip distribution curves from the two models are similar, but both average and peak trip lengths of the two are significantly different. Mode split analyses show that the TBRPM may underestimate driving trips and fail to capture any usage of alternative modes, such as taxi and nonmotorized (e.g., walking and bicycling) modes. In addition, the ABTDMs are found to be less capable of reproducing observed traffic counts when compared to the TBRPM, most likely due to not considering external and through trips. The comparative results presented can help transportation engineers and planners better understand the strengths and weaknesses of the two types of model and this should assist decision-makers in choosing a better modeling tool for their planning initiatives.},

  abstract = {To understand whether telecommuting could be part of the policy solutions for greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction in the transportation sector, this study uses instrumental variable Tobit models and data from 2001 and 2009 National Household Travel Surveys to explore whether telecommuting reduces or increases the daily work and non-work vehicle miles traveled (VMT). Our findings suggest telecommuters have more VMT for both daily work and non-work trips than non-telecommuters. Adding the findings that telecommuting has no impact on other non-working household member's daily total (non-work) trips, we can possibly argue that households with telecommuter(s) tend to have higher daily total VMT. Our estimated marginal effect of telecommuting on worker's daily total trips indicates that a telecommuter on average travels 38 vehicle miles more on a daily basis in 2001 and 45 vehicle miles more in 2009 compared with a non-telecommuter. These increases in VMT translate into a rather large increase in GHG emissions in the US equivalent to adding 7,248,845 cars in 2001 and 8,808,165 in 2009 to the road. Moreover, the difference of this marginal effect between 2001 and 2009 suggests the impact of telecommuting on worker's daily total VMT had increased over time. With the emerging work arrangements to work from home, telecommuting has been welcomed in this changing environment, not only by individual workers and employers but also policymakers. But the outcomes seem to be opposite to what policy makers may have expected for GHG emission reductions.},

  abstract = {In this paper, data from the National Personal Transportation Survey (NPTS), the American Travel Survey (ATS), the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CES), and the U.S. Bureau of the Census are used to examine the intersection of consumer culture and travel behavior, particularly as consumerism might influence differences in travel behavior by race/ethnicity. The data indicate that buying power and purchasing behavior among African Americans and Hispanics is increasing at the same time that the trips for consumer activities are nearing 50 percent of all trips made. Differences by race/ethnicity in travel mode and time of travel for consumer activities will significantly impact overall travel behavior patterns in major urban centers where African Americans and Hispanics are most concentrated. Finally, the social context of consumer activities among African Americans and Hispanics indicates that their trip making for consumer purposes will not be significantly influenced by e-commerce. This paper also suggests that coverage bias hampers analyses of differences by race/ethnicity using NPTS and ATS data.},
