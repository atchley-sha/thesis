	abstract = {This paper studies the properties and performance of a new measure of accessibility, called the activity-based accessibility (ABA) measure, and compares it to traditional measures of accessibility, including isochrone, gravity and utility-based measures. The novel aspect of the ABA is that it measures accessibility to all activities in which an individual engages, incorporating constraints such as scheduling, and travel characteristics such as trip chaining. The ABA is generated from the day activity schedule (DAS) model system, an integrated system based on the concept of an activity pattern, which identifies the sequence and tour structure among all the activities and trips taken by an individual during a day. A byproduct is an individual’s expected maximum utility over the choices of all available activity patterns, and from this the ABA is derived. The ABA is related to the logsum accessibility measures frequently derived from destination and mode discrete choice models. The key difference is that it is generated not by examining a particular trip, but by examining all trips and activities throughout the day. A case study using data from Portland, Oregon, demonstrates the rich picture of accessibility made available by use of the ABA, and highlights differences between the ABA and more traditional measures of accessibility. The ABA is successful in (a) capturing taste heterogeneity across individuals (not possible with aggregate accessibility measures), (b) combining different types of trips into a unified measure of accessibility (not possible with trip-based measures), (c) reflecting the impact of scheduling and trip chaining on accessibility (not possible with trip-based measures), and (d) quantifying differing accessibility impacts on important segments of the population such as unemployed and zero auto households (not possible with aggregate measures, and limited with trip-based measures).},

A prototype demonstrates the system concept using a 1991 Boston travel survey and transportation system level of service data. The model system represents a person’s choice of activities and associated travel as an activity pattern overarching a set of tours. A tour is defined as the travel from home to one or more activity locations and back home again. The activity pattern consists of important decisions that provide overall structure for the day’s activities and travel. In the prototype the activity pattern includes (a) the primary – most important – activity of the day, with one alternative being to remain at home for all the day’s activities; (b) the type of tour for the primary activity, including the number, purpose and sequence of activity stops; and (c) the number and purpose of secondary – additional – tours. Tour models include the choice of time of day, destination and mode of travel, and are conditioned by the choice of activity pattern. The choice of activity pattern is influenced by the expected maximum utility derived from the available tour alternatives.},

Region- and project-level comparisons of the performance of the trip- and tour-based models were made for three scenario years: 1990, 2000, and 2005. The region-level analysis was undertaken in the context of four travel dimensions on the basis of data availability and observed data to model output compatibility. These four dimensions were vehicle ownership, work flow distribution, work flow distribution by time of day, and average work trip travel time. The tour-based model performed better overall than the trip-based model for all four dimensions. The project-level comparative assessment of the predicted link volumes from the trip-based and the tour-based models was undertaken according to the observed link counts and roadway functional class. The results did not show any clear trends according to the performance of the models by functional class or year.},

The first objective of this paper is to present a research framework for the equity analysis of long-range transportation plans, for the purpose of critiquing the current state of practice and pointing to key research needs. This research framework is used to identify four research areas for furthering transportation equity analysis: (a) identifying transportation priorities for different groups of interest, (b) identifying appropriate modeling tools for measuring equity outcomes, (c) identifying and analyzing equity indicators, and (d) linking the equity indicators and the transportation priorities. The second objective is to explore how well an activity-based travel demand model represents heterogeneity of travel behavior among different income classes, for the purpose of transportation equity analysis. Graphical and statistical tools are used to access how well a sample of the model data compares with a sample of travel survey data for the San Francisco Bay Area in California. The results show that although the tests of distribution equality fail, the general shape of the distributions, the central tendencies, and the relative difference of the low- versus high-income samples perform well.},

In this paper we first discuss a general framework for performing transportation equity analysis using activity-based travel demand models, distributional comparisons, and incorporating equity standards. In addition, we demonstrate the advantages of distributional comparisons, relative to average measures. This demonstration uses the 2000 Bay Area Travel Survey and (activity-based) mode choice model. The findings show that distributional comparisons are capable of clearly revealing the winners and losers that result from transportation improvements, in comparison with average measures. The use of these results will likely result in different conclusions on transportation investments.},

Trip distribution—whether the trip is intrazonal (internal) or interzonal (external)—is one of the essential steps in travel demand forecasting. However, the current intrazonal forecasts based on a gravity model involve flawed assumptions, primarily due to a lack of considerations on differences in zone size, land use, and street network patterns. In this study, we first survey 25 MPOs about how they model intrazonal travel and find the state of the practice to be dominated by the gravity model. Using travel data from 31 diverse regions in the U.S., we develop an approach to enhance the conventional model by including more built environment D variables and by using multilevel logistic regression. The models’ predictive capability is confirmed using k-fold cross-validation. The study results provide practical implications for state and local planning and transportation agencies with better accuracy and generalizability.},

The activity-travel framework view people as living on a daily basis by participating in a sequence of activities, in order to satisfy basic needs and less essential preferences. Although undoubtedly a considerable advance, viewed from the perspective of the activity-travel framework the existing disaggregate travel demand models contain a number of fundamental limitations and appear more as a refinement of existing approaches than a radical departure from them.
