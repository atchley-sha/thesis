	abstract = {Activity-based travel demand models can be useful tools for understanding the individual level equity impacts of transportation plans, because of their ability to generate disaggregate transportation measures. However, these capabilities have yet to be fully explored in public practice. In this paper we first discuss a general framework for performing transportation equity analysis using activity-based travel demand models, distributional comparisons, and incorporating equity standards. In addition, we demonstrate the advantages of distributional comparisons, relative to average measures. This demonstration uses the 2000 Bay Area Travel Survey and (activity-based) mode choice model. The findings show that distributional comparisons are capable of clearly revealing the winners and losers that result from transportation improvements, in comparison with average measures. The use of these results will likely result in different conclusions on transportation investments.},

	abstract = {The current state of practice for transportation equity analysis is moving toward the use of activity-based travel models for scenario analysis. However, little has been done to validate the use of these models for equity analysis. The first objective of this paper is to present a research framework for the equity analysis of long-range transportation plans, for the purpose of critiquing the current state of practice and pointing to key research needs. This research framework is used to identify four research areas for furthering transportation equity analysis: (a) identifying transportation priorities for different groups of interest, (b) identifying appropriate modeling tools for measuring equity outcomes, (c) identifying and analyzing equity indicators, and (d) linking the equity indicators and the transportation priorities. The second objective is to explore how well an activity-based travel demand model represents heterogeneity of travel behavior among different income classes, for the purpose of transportation equity analysis. Graphical and statistical tools are used to access how well a sample of the model data compares with a sample of travel survey data for the San Francisco Bay Area in California. The results show that although the tests of distribution equality fail, the general shape of the distributions, the central tendencies, and the relative difference of the low- versus high-income samples perform well.},

A prototype demonstrates the system concept using a 1991 Boston travel survey and transportation system level of service data. The model system represents a person’s choice of activities and associated travel as an activity pattern overarching a set of tours. A tour is defined as the travel from home to one or more activity locations and back home again. The activity pattern consists of important decisions that provide overall structure for the day’s activities and travel. In the prototype the activity pattern includes (a) the primary – most important – activity of the day, with one alternative being to remain at home for all the day’s activities; (b) the type of tour for the primary activity, including the number, purpose and sequence of activity stops; and (c) the number and purpose of secondary – additional – tours. Tour models include the choice of time of day, destination and mode of travel, and are conditioned by the choice of activity pattern. The choice of activity pattern is influenced by the expected maximum utility derived from the available tour alternatives.},

The region-level analysis was undertaken in the context of four travel dimensions on the basis of data availability and observed data to model output compatibility. These four dimensions were vehicle ownership, work flow distribution, work flow distribution by time of day, and average work trip travel time. The tour-based model performed better overall than the trip-based model for all four dimensions. The project-level comparative assessment of the predicted link volumes from the trip-based and the tour-based models was undertaken according to the observed link counts and roadway functional class. The results did not show any clear trends according to the performance of the models by functional class or year.},

	abstract = {This paper studies the properties and performance of a new measure of accessibility, called the activity-based accessibility (ABA) measure, and compares it to traditional measures of accessibility, including isochrone, gravity and utility-based measures. The novel aspect of the ABA is that it measures accessibility to all activities in which an individual engages, incorporating constraints such as scheduling, and travel characteristics such as trip chaining. The ABA is generated from the day activity schedule (DAS) model system, an integrated system based on the concept of an activity pattern, which identifies the sequence and tour structure among all the activities and trips taken by an individual during a day. A byproduct is an individual’s expected maximum utility over the choices of all available activity patterns, and from this the ABA is derived. The ABA is related to the logsum accessibility measures frequently derived from destination and mode discrete choice models. The key difference is that it is generated not by examining a particular trip, but by examining all trips and activities throughout the day. A case study using data from Portland, Oregon, demonstrates the rich picture of accessibility made available by use of the ABA, and highlights differences between the ABA and more traditional measures of accessibility. The ABA is successful in (a) capturing taste heterogeneity across individuals (not possible with aggregate accessibility measures), (b) combining different types of trips into a unified measure of accessibility (not possible with trip-based measures), (c) reflecting the impact of scheduling and trip chaining on accessibility (not possible with trip-based measures), and (d) quantifying differing accessibility impacts on important segments of the population such as unemployed and zero auto households (not possible with aggregate measures, and limited with trip-based measures).},

The activity-travel framework view people as living on a daily basis by participating in a sequence of activities, in order to satisfy basic needs and less essential preferences. Although undoubtedly a considerable advance, viewed from the perspective of the activity-travel framework the existing disaggregate travel demand models contain a number of fundamental limitations and appear more as a refinement of existing approaches than a radical departure from them.

	abstract = {Conventional four-step travel demand models, used by most metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs), state departments of transportation, and local planning agencies, are the basis for long-range transportation planning in the United States. Trip distribution—whether the trip is intrazonal (internal) or interzonal (external)—is one of the essential steps in travel demand forecasting. However, the current intrazonal forecasts based on a gravity model involve flawed assumptions, primarily due to a lack of considerations on differences in zone size, land use, and street network patterns. In this study, we first survey 25 MPOs about how they model intrazonal travel and find the state of the practice to be dominated by the gravity model. Using travel data from 31 diverse regions in the U.S., we develop an approach to enhance the conventional model by including more built environment D variables and by using multilevel logistic regression. The models’ predictive capability is confirmed using k-fold cross-validation. The study results provide practical implications for state and local planning and transportation agencies with better accuracy and generalizability.},

	abstract = {Intra-household interactions constitute an important aspect in modeling activity and travel-related decisions. Recognition of this importance has recently produced a growing body of research on various aspects of modeling intra-household interactions and group decision-making mechanisms as well as first attempts to incorporate intra-household interactions in regional travel demand models. The previously published research works were mostly focused on time allocation aspect and less on generation of activity episodes, trips, and travel tours that are necessary units for compatibility with regional travel demand models. Also, most of the approaches were limited to household heads only and did not consider explicitly the other household members as acting agents in the intra-household decision making. A model is proposed for joint choice of daily activity pattern (DAP) types for all household members that explicitly takes into account added group-wise utilities of joint participation in the same activity. The model is based on the aggregate description of individual DAP types by three main categories – mandatory travel pattern, non-mandatory travel pattern, and at-home pattern. Important intra-household interactions can be captured already at this aggregate level. A choice structure considers all possible combinations of DAPs of all household members as alternatives. Utility function of each alternative includes components corresponding to each individual DAP type as well as group-wise interaction terms that correspond to joint choice of the same pattern by several household members. Statistical analysis of intra-household interactions and estimation results of the choice model are presented. The model estimation has confirmed a strong added utility of joint choice of the same pattern for such person types as non-worker or part time worker in combination with child, two retired persons, two children, and others. The proposed model represents a part of the advanced regional model system being developed for the Atlanta Regional Commission.},

	abstract = {Two competing approaches to travel demand modeling exist today. The more traditional four-step travel demand models rely on aggregate demographic data at a traffic analysis zone (TAZ) level. Activity-based microsimulation methods use more robust behavioral theory while focusing on individuals and households. Although the vast majority of U.S. metropolitan planning organizations continue to rely on traditional models, many modelers believe that activity-based approaches promise greater predictive capability, more accurate forecasts, and more realistic sensitivity to policy changes. Little work has examined in detail the benefits of activity-based models relative to more traditional approaches. To understand better the trade-offs between these two methodologies, results produced by both were modeled in an Austin, Texas, application. Three scenarios are examined: a base scenario, a scenario with expanded capacity along two key freeways, and a centralized-employment scenario. Results of the analysis revealed several differences in model performance and accuracy in terms of replicating travel survey and traffic count data. Such distinctions largely emerged through differing model assumptions. In general, activity-based models were more sensitive to changes in model inputs, supporting the notion that aggregate models ignore important behavioral distinctions across the population. However, they involved more effort and care in data manipulation, model calibration, and application to mimic behavioral processes better at a finer resolution. Such efforts help ensure that synthetic populations match key criteria and that activity schedules match surveyed behaviors, while being realistic and consistent across household members.},

	abstract = {The most common travel demand model type is the trip-based model, despite major shortcomings due to its aggregate nature. Activity-based models overcome many of the limitations of the trip-based model, but implementing and calibrating an activity-based model is labor-intensive and running an activity-based model often takes long runtimes. This paper proposes a hybrid called MITO (Microsimulation Transport Orchestrator) that overcomes some of the limitations of trip-based models, yet is easier to implement than an activity-based model. MITO uses microsimulation to simulate each household and person individually. After trip generation, the travel time budget in minutes is calculated for every household. This budget influences destination choice; i.e., people who spent a lot of time commuting are less likely to do much other travel, while people who telecommute might compensate by additional discretionary travel. Mode choice uses a nested logit model, and time-of-day choice schedules trips in 1-minute intervals. Three case studies demonstrate how individuals may be traced through the entire model system from trip generation to the assignment.},

	abstract = {There is a large gap between the aggregate, trip-based models used by transportation planning agencies and the activity-based, microsimulation methods espoused by those at the forefront of research. The modeling environment presented here is intended to bridge this gap by providing a palatable way for planning agencies to move toward advanced methods. Three components to bridging the gap are emphasized: an incremental approach, a demonstration of clear gains, and a provision of an environment that eases initial implementation and allows for expansion. The modeling environment (called STEP2) is a household microsimulator, developed in TransCAD, that can be used to implement a four-step model as well as models with longer-term behavior and trip chaining. An implementation for southern Nevada is described, and comparisons are made with the region's aggregate four-step model. The models perform similarly in numerous ways. A key advantage to the microsimulator is that it provides impacts by socioeconomic group (essential for equity analysis) and individual trip movements (for use in a vehicle microsimulator). A sensitivity analysis indicates that the microsimulation model has less inelastic cross elasticity of transit demand with respect to auto travel times than the aggregate model (aggregation error). The trade-off is that microsimulators have simulation error; results are presented regarding the severity of this error. This work shows that a shift to microsimulation does not necessarily require substantial investment to achieve many of the benefits. One of the greatest advantages is a flexible environment that can expand to include additional sensitivity to demographics and transportation policy variables.},
