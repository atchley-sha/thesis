  abstract = {Since the beginning of civilization, the viability and economic success of communities have been, to a major extent, determined by the efficiency of the transportation infrastructure. To make informed transportation infrastructure planning decisions, planners and engineers have to be able to forecast the response of transportation demand to changes in the attributes of the transportation system and changes in the attributes of the people using the transportation system. Travel demand models are used for this purpose; specifically, travel demand models are used to predict travel characteristics and usage of transport services under alternative socio-economic scenarios, and for alternative transport service and land-use configurations.},

  abstract = {We present an integrated activity-based discrete choice model system of an individual's activity and travel schedule, for forecasting urban passenger travel demand. A prototype demonstrates the system concept using a 1991 Boston travel survey and transportation system level of service data. The model system represents a person's choice of activities and associated travel as an activity pattern overarching a set of tours. A tour is defined as the travel from home to one or more activity locations and back home again. The activity pattern consists of important decisions that provide overall structure for the day's activities and travel. In the prototype the activity pattern includes (a) the primary -- most important -- activity of the day, with one alternative being to remain at home for all the day's activities; (b) the type of tour for the primary activity, including the number, purpose and sequence of activity stops; and (c) the number and purpose of secondary -- additional -- tours. Tour models include the choice of time of day, destination and mode of travel, and are conditioned by the choice of activity pattern. The choice of activity pattern is influenced by the expected maximum utility derived from the available tour alternatives.},

  abstract = {Regional travel models in the United States are clearly evolving from conventional models towards a new generation of more behaviorally realistic activity-based models. The new generation of regional travel demand models is characterized by three features: (1) an activity-based platform, that implies that modeled travel be derived within a general framework of the daily activities undertaken by households and persons, (2) a tour-based structure of travel where the tour is used as the basic unit of modeling travel instead of the elemental trip, and (3) micro-simulation modeling techniques that are applied at the fully-disaggregate level of persons and households, which convert activity and travel related choices from fractional-probability model outcomes into a series of discrete or ``crisp'' decisions. While the new generation of model has obvious conceptual advantages over the conventional four-step models, there are still numerous technical issues that have to be addressed as well as a better understanding of practical benefits should be achieved before the new generation of models can fully replace conventional models. The paper summarizes the recent successful experience in the development and application of activity-based demand models for Metropolitan Planning Organizations in the US. Moving activity-based approaches into practice is analyzed in a broad context of travel demand modeling market tendencies and policy implications.},
