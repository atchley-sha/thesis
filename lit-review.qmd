# Literature Review

In the early 1990s, research began in a new "activity-based" modeling framework as an alternative to the traditional "four-step" or "trip-based" approaches (Rasouli and Timmermans, 2013). This was part of a broader shift toward research in behavioral models over aggregate spatial interaction models in urban planning and regional science that began in the 1970s. Rasouli()() list several arguments for this shift: four-step models use several sub-models that are (implicitly or explicitly) assumed independent, and this can result in a lack of consistency or integrity between sub-models; four-step models are strongly aggregated in nature, which can cause significant aggregation bias; and these models lack "behavioral realism"---that is, they do not have a concept of individuals making decisions, which is what travel behavior actually is.

Activity-based models (ABMs) were proposed as a means of addressing the shortcomings of traditional four-step models. Unlike four-step models, ABMs place the focus on "activities" rather than "trips" as the basic unit of analysis. ABMs predict a sequence of activities for each individual and household, with information such as activity location, start time, and duration using a high level of temporal and spatial granularity. "Trips" are then the result of getting from one activity to the next. By adopting this activity-centric framework, ABMs provide a more consistent and comprehensive representation of travel behavior. They take into account complex dependencies and interactions within the model as a whole and at an individual level. ABMs acknowledge that travel choices are not made in isolation, but rather influenced by the preceding activities. This means that e.g. if an individual takes transit to work, they will not be able to drive home. ABMs therefore present a more conceptually accurate model of actual travel behavior than traditional four-step models.

Despite these advantages, however, many agencies have yet to adopt ABMs, instead continuing to use four-step models. While ABMs are superior in certain aspects, they also have disadvantages, such as requiring more detailed input data and greater computational resources. It is also not always clear if ABMs provide substantially better forecasts than their four-step counterparts, nor if this tradeoff is worth it for every agency. This literature review presents an overview of both modeling frameworks, and discusses the potential advantages and disadvantages from using an ABM.

This section/chapter discusses these advantages after an overview of the two types of models.

## Comparison of Modeling Frameworks

A key component of any travel demand model is how the population data is structured. There are two main approaches to this: summary statistics or a synthetic population.

Paragraph explaining diagram of information flow for both types. Note that if data is aggregated at any step in the summary stats pipeline, you can't undo that. Not so with a synthetic population.

```

ABMs require **<fact-check>** a synthetic population since the focus is on individuals.

TBMs, with few exceptions, use summary statistics.

These exceptions are worth noting, however. TBMs can use a synthetic population (microsimulation). So what then is the difference? "ABM"s are really "tour-based". This is in a sense a subset of "AB", since an individual's daily activities are scheduled and the tour arises from this. However, other types of ABMs are theoretically possible, and some exist in practice (incl. "activity scheduling" models; this includes I believe MATSim, maybe we should talk about that).

Additional paragraph.

## Claimed Advantages

ABMs are often lauded as superior to TBMs due to their usage of synthetic populations and trip-chaining (tours), which is considered to better represent individual choices.

However, ABMs do have measurable disadvantages as well. They are computationally expensive and need more data....

It is clear that a synthetic population has distinct advantages over summary statistics. Certain analyses... (equity: don't want to code race/income/gender into mode choice, but want to group results thereby; not possible with summary stats).

Cite Bills and others showing advantages of synthetic population.

These claimed advantages are attributed to the ABM over the TBM, which is mostly correct. As mentioned previously, very few TBMs use a synthetic population, though it's not impossible.

A true advantage of the ABM ("tour-based") over the TBM is the idea of trip-chaining (or tours). Rather than model each trip individually, ABMs model an entire day's activities as zero or more "tours" (travel away from and return to home).

Modeling travel in this way allows for several advantages, including consistent mode choice (a car won't be driven home if it wasn't taken to work). Additionally, further types of analysis are possible, such as Dong et al.'s "activity-based accessibility" measure. <Explain what that is>.

Other advantages or analyses that tours let us perform. Probably a few paragraphs. Maybe it's worth mentioning MATSim or similar again.

Despite these claimed advantages, agencies in practice don't seem to switch very readily; many still use TBMs. There may be several reasons for this (incl. the disadvantages mentioned above).

## Research Gap

ABMs and TBMs have been researched extensively, with ABMs claiming many advantages over TBMs. Additionally, there are disadvantages of ABMs, and {synthetic vs summary stats} $\neq$ {ABM vs TBM}.

However, as of yet there are no side-by-side comparisons of ABMs and TBMs, using the same proposed development scenarios in both. This research seeks to close that gap by modeling multiple scenarios in a TBM and ABM and comparing the strengths and weaknesses of each. What input data is needed? What computational resources are needed? What analyses can we do with each type of model? Are certain types of scenarios suited to one or the other? And ultimately, is there a clear winner between ABMs and TBMs?
