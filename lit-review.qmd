# Literature Review

In the 1970s??, research began in a new "activity-based" modeling framework as an alternative to the traditional "four-step" or "trip-based" approaches.

Activity-based models (ABMs) differ from trip-based models (TBMs) in several ways.

ABMs also claim several advantages over TBMs, including....

This section/chapter discusses these advantages after an overview of the two types of models.

## Comparison of Modeling Frameworks

A key component of any travel demand model is how the population data is structured. There are two main approaches to this: summary statistics or a synthetic population.

Paragraph explaining diagram of information flow for both types. Note that if data is aggregated at any step in the summary stats pipeline, you can't undo that. Not so with a synthetic population.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(igraph)
library(ggnetwork)

tbm_nodes <- read_csv("data/flowchart_comparison/tbm_nodes.csv")
tbm_edges <- read_csv("data/flowchart_comparison/tbm_edges.csv")
tbm_layout <- tbm_nodes %>% 
  select(h,v) %>% 
  as.matrix()

tbm_flowchart <- graph_from_data_frame(tbm_edges, vertices = tbm_nodes) %>% ggnetwork(layout = tbm_layout) %>% 
  mutate(veh_own = str_to_title(veh_own) %>% factor(c("Yes", "No")),
         income = str_to_title(income) %>% factor(c("High", "Low")))

tbm_flowchart %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_edges(aes(x, y, xend = xend, yend = yend)) +
  geom_nodes(aes(x, y, shape = veh_own, color = income), size = 20) +
  geom_text(aes(x, y, label = label)) +
  geom_label(x = -0.3, y = 1, label = "Population") +
  geom_label(x = -0.3, y = 0.5, label = "Trip Generation") +
  geom_label(x = -0.3, y = 0, label = "Mode Choice") +
  lims(x = c(-0.4, 1.1), y = c(-0.1, 1.1)) +
  scale_color_manual(na.value = "#d4d4d4", values = c("High" = "#7fcdbb", "Low" = "#2c7fb8")) +
  scale_shape_manual(values = c("Yes" = 15, "No" = 16)) +
  labs(color = "Income Group", shape = "Vehicle Ownership") +
  guides(shape = guide_legend(override.aes = list(size = 10)),
         color = guide_legend(override.aes = list(size = 10))) +
  theme_void()

```

ABMs require **<fact-check>** a synthetic population since the focus is on individuals.

TBMs, with few exceptions, use summary statistics.

These exceptions are worth noting, however. TBMs can use a synthetic population (microsimulation). So what then is the difference? "ABM"s are really "tour-based". This is in a sense a subset of "AB", since an individual's daily activities are scheduled and the tour arises from this. However, other types of ABMs are theoretically possible, and some exist in practice (incl. "activity scheduling" models; this includes I believe MATSim, maybe we should talk about that).

Additional paragraph.

## Claimed Advantages

ABMs are often lauded as superior to TBMs due to their usage of synthetic populations and trip-chaining (tours), which is considered to better represent individual choices.

However, ABMs do have measurable disadvantages as well. They are computationally expensive and need more data....

It is clear that a synthetic population has distinct advantages over summary statistics. Certain analyses... (equity: don't want to code race/income/gender into mode choice, but want to group results thereby; not possible with summary stats).

Cite Bills and others showing advantages of synthetic population.

These claimed advantages are attributed to the ABM over the TBM, which is mostly correct. As mentioned previously, very few TBMs use a synthetic population, though it's not impossible.

A true advantage of the ABM ("tour-based") over the TBM is the idea of trip-chaining (or tours). Rather than model each trip individually, ABMs model an entire day's activities as zero or more "tours" (travel away from and return to home).

Modeling travel in this way allows for several advantages, including consistent mode choice (a car won't be driven home if it wasn't taken to work). Additionally, further types of analysis are possible, such as Dong et al.'s "activity-based accessibility" measure. <Explain what that is>.

Other advantages or analyses that tours let us perform. Probably a few paragraphs. Maybe it's worth mentioning MATSim or similar again.

Despite these claimed advantages, agencies in practice don't seem to switch very readily; many still use TBMs. There may be several reasons for this (incl. the disadvantages mentioned above).

## Research Gap

ABMs and TBMs have been researched extensively, with ABMs claiming many advantages over TBMs. Additionally, there are disadvantages of ABMs, and {synthetic vs summary stats} $\neq$ {ABM vs TBM}.

However, as of yet there are no side-by-side comparisons of ABMs and TBMs, using the same proposed development scenarios in both. This research seeks to close that gap by modeling multiple scenarios in a TBM and ABM and comparing the strengths and weaknesses of each. What input data is needed? What computational resources are needed? What analyses can we do with each type of model? Are certain types of scenarios suited to one or the other? And ultimately, is there a clear winner between ABMs and TBMs?
