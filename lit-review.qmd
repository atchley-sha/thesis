# Literature Review

***(outline)***

The Review should explore analyses done by others using either a trip- or activity-based model. It should focus on the types of analyses that can be done with either kind of model, in particular noting when a certain analysis is made easier or even possible by one or the other. There are several types of analyses that can be done:

- Equity: How does transportation impact minority and low-income groups?
  - Bills et al., 2012
  - Bills and Walker, 2017
  - Nahmias-Biran and Shiftan, 2016
  - Pereira et al., 2017
- Accessibility: What kinds of measures can we calculate, and how are they useful?
  - Dong et al., 2006
- Resilience? This might be just an assignment thing, but maybe it would have an influence on mode/destination choice?
  - Ganin et al., 2107

Possible analyses:

- Ridership (incl. by {stop|demographic|land use})
- Facility needs assessment
- Logsums?
