# README

This folder contains skims, trip matrices, and trip lists necessary for comparing the base ActivitySim run to the base WFRC run (also synthetic population and zonal SE data).
These are very large files that are currently hosted on Box.
They may end up in git LFS at some point.
Files that are small enough are included in the repo.
