# Land Use

In our first scenario, we changes the land use at The Point.

The change is based on WFRC 2050 SE data forecast, in turn based on development plan of The Point.

This adds X jobs and X households, etc. (show map)

## Creating the scenario

In the WFRC model the change is trivial to implement.
We just copy/pasted the se data from 2050 to 2019 for the affected zones.

ActivitySim requires two things for this scenario: updated SE data and a new pop.
The updated SE data is the same as in the WFRC scenario, so is also trivial to implement.
The pop, however, is not.
New controls.

New population for only the affected area, then joined to existing.
There were no existing households so we didn't need to remove any (we're not double-counting).

? Note in realistic scenario you could use just the land use forecast as controls directly, rahter than the whole census shenanigains but we didn't do that.
